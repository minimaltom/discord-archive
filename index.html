          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I find it very distracting bringing in concepts and terminology from philosophical schools that come after Hegel like zizek and lacan etc. especially as we're only into the preface!!! 😄  Cant people just kind of stick to the text in itself. I want to learn what Hegel is saying himself, like a line by line comprehension. I thought that was the whole point of this.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Doug you say the first preface mentioned language? I cant see that anywhere, i think thats something you brought in from 20th century reading of it</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> or at least explain where you got that conclusion. Sorry I may have missed something when i read it but i couldnt find any direct mention of language

edit: ok what confused me here is you are talking about the first preface but referencing the second preface which i hadnt read up until now, and you did expect us to read both before the workshop so thats kind of fair i guess</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> obviously im exagerating about line by line, you have to grasp a lot by yourself and it requires knowledge of previous philosphers like kant and fichte ect.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> you all completely FAILED to talk about the first preface imo 😄  its dissapointing, Thomas you need to wind your neck in and let someone else have the floor, your conclusions are all based on basic misunderstandings</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> like speculation means predicting the future??? you dont know what youre talking about, thats not the meaning of speculation Hegel is using. Or you claim Kant was all about knowing what the thing in itself is. Thats the opposite of what he wanted, he refused to comment on the nature of reality in itself because we can't know anything about it.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I thought we could move past the computer science analogy by focusing on language, but I’m also aware not everyone here has practical experience with translation and difference so maybe my comment wasn’t as spot-on as I had hoped.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I myself am not super well-versed in Hegelian “lore”. I’ve only read PoS and I’m a mental health professional, so I didn’t read it for academic purposes but rather practical ones.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think it helps to give an example of abstract uses of language that might help a thinker form a more critical consciousness of their own engagement, but "it's a toss-up" as they say.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@actualvargas#0</span> Andrew is kind of in the same profession I guess as a therapist. I like what he said about the goal of therapy being about helping people to realise they dont have to live up to what society tells us a well functioning person in society should be like. Thats not directly related to the book tho</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think Andrew was the only one who actually made a first stab at a real analysis when he talked about the need for Logic to be kind of based on its own terms.

Dougs mention of the French revolution and the rise of napoleon was something I would never have known from reading it and seems to be what Hegel is refering to at the start of the first preferance about the development in consciousness over the past 25 years. That is something I would have like to go into more detail about maybe</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Here's the section on language from the first preface: The forms of thought are, in the first instance, displayed and stored as human language. Nowadays we cannot be too often reminded that it is thinking which distinguishes man from the beasts. Into all that becomes something inward for men, an image or conception as such, into all that he makes his own, language has penetrated, and everything that he has transformed into language and expresses in it contains a category – concealed, mixed with other forms or clearly determined as such, so much is Logic his natural element, indeed his own peculiar nature... 
That's the beginning of section 14.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> What's important to understand about this first workshop is that Hegel is pointing to the deficiencies in scientific thinking that he experienced in his era. While the reference to computer science may seem like a nonsequitur, it was in fact a predictable response in a way as there is a commonly held belief that the sciences have advanced since Hegel's time. The question is whether scientific understanding has overcome the impasse that Hegel is attempting to address in his Science of Logic or not.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The science of logic is a book about discovering the metaphysics of logic and the logic of metaphysics. That is, it an attempt to ground science, to rediscover its substance.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> If you think about how Hegel was not merely talking about what we think of as the Empirical sciences today, but was also talking about a transformation that took place at the level of politics, you might begin to see why bringing up the Stock Market isn't entirely irrelevant.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Consider this: Though these two sciences have been universally and abundantly cultivated, the latter even up to our own day, the interest taken in the speculative side has been only slight; in fact, on the whole, the same material has been just repeated over and over again, sometimes being thinned out to the point of being trivial and superficial and sometimes more of the old ballast has been hauled out afresh and trailed along with logic. From such efforts, often purely mechanical, the philosophical import of the science could gain nothing.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> So, the two sciences are logic and metaphysics. Hegel is saying that these sciences have become hollow shells, unrelated to the world of appearance. Relegated off from serious attempts at understanding. Trivial and superficial.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> So, what Thomas claimed was that computer science has a method for arriving at Truth or at least developing toward it that relies on negation. That is, he basically restated Popper's falsification theory of science as an answer to Hegel.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> To be fair to Thomas, that's what Hegel is claiming has happened to thinking in general. It is built on presuppositions rather than speculative science.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Having read the Phenomenology I found it possible to read without an extraordinary effort, but it is a difficult text. And perhaps I am misunderstanding aspects of it. This is why I don't insist on having my view of the text dominate and try to remember to characterize the "workshop" as a discussion group and not a course.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Okay, The infamous Thomas Here --- Just read this... 

Don't worry, I did read the prefaces. And various sections of the book previously when trying to understand a secondary source, though never the entire book in a single go. 

So there are a couple of things going on with my stock market interpretation --- The first is I would point out that capitalism, as interpreted by Zizek, is itself a religious movement as well as a material one and the movements of the stock market are thus themselves metaphysical in nature. So when capitalists speak of speculation on the stock market... that is a metaphysical statement as well as a 'physical statement'. I am not dumping or giving up on the original concern with 'god' rather I'm concerned with god (or rather the social gheist) as it actually exists in our modern society: i.e. with capitalism itself. I am circling back, as well, however, and making a somewhat different claim from Popper's --- Popper says that in order for a theory to be a scientific one it must be falsifiable, however I would add to that, that we also need to know the conditions of falsification itself (i.e. logic/contradiction) which takes the question further than Popper.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Second, as for my presuppositions --- I would point to the text itself:


As for bringing in my own understanding I would point to the prefaces themselves and we can explore if what I'm doing is a bad method. The first is the entry point of the second preface:

"To exhibit the realm of thought philosophically, that is, in its own immanent activity or what is the same, in its necessary development,® had therefore to be a fresh undertaking, one that had to be started right from the beginning; but this traditional material, the familiar forms of thought, must be regarded as an extremely important source, indeed as a necessary condition and as a presupposition to be gratefully acknowledged even though what it offers is only here and there a meagre shred or a disordered heap of dead bones ®."

I don't read this as saying we need to dump all our presuppositions but rather we need to surface them, make them conscious --- so I am doing that for myself and in the proces hopefully drawing them out for others. Another statement from the text:

"This restriction to what is simple gives scope for the free play of caprice which does not want to remain simple but brings in its own reflections on the subject matter. Having good right to occupy itself at first only with the principle and in doing so not to concern itself with what lies beyond it, this thoroughness actually proceeds to do the opposite of this, for it does bring in what lies beyond, that is, categories other than those which constitute the principle itself, other presuppositions and prejudices." 

--- the way I read this, it is not actually possible for us to proceed without presupposition, rather we must bring them into the discussion if we are to proceed at all. The only way to proceed analytically is to actually work through the linguistic knots as they exist for the participants.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Finally, I don't think that the idea that we are going to go through the whole text line by line is actually a goal of the reading group (though It is open to patrons and so we can make of it what we will by participating...) I don't think that would necessarily be a very enlightening or interesting discussion because the text is available, you can read it, what's the value add? What is important, educational, and entertaining (these things are not all in complete contradiction with each other) is the commentary on the various parts of the text. My question here would be... are you simply trying to get us to read the text for you? Because if so, we cannot.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> P.S. also on the Kant stuff --- I either misspoke or was misheard: my point wasn't that Kant tells us what the thing-in-itself is, that he gives us access to truth. My point is that he's always *attempting* to do so and failing through some kind of a deterministic logic. He keeps circling this thing-in-itself in the pattern of 'Here I will attempt to find the thing-in-itself.... [theory noises]... I was unable to find the thing-in-itself' and Hegel's response is, 'there will always be a necessary phenominal-neumenal gap and that gap *is* the thing-in-itself, i.e. being-in-itself/contingency/contradiction'.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Maybe you should just join in on the next one and add to the conversation if you feel like it was lacking.. if you felt like it wasn't going where it should have maybe you could play a facilitation role? I was in the conversation (well, I was listening and didn't have much to contribute yet) but that's the role any one of us should be playing if we're going to learn from each other through this.

It's okay to be disappointed, just don't just stay there.. What needs changing and where can you contribute to that to make our next workshop more of what you'd think could be helpful to you and hopefully others as well.

I've only read Hegel through Marx and some others so I'm not going to pretend anyone was wasting time in the workshop.. Though I understand your frustration (which seems to stem from your not feeling certain topics were discussed or things went off tangent).. so help us with that comrade! Join us!</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@za77ack#0</span> Yes I overeacted, this is the first workshop everybodys getting a feel for everybody else, its not going to go perfect and its not a course its a discussion, but I had some valid points.

I dont want the group to go this way everytime - Thomas says something extremely high level and obscure that no-one understands, doesnt refer to the reading material at all and doesnt try and explain himself, Doug doesnt know what the hell hes on about either but is too unsure in himself to challenge him and now everybody is consumed with trying to get fit the workshop around what Thomas said for the whole discussion and barely anything of substance is achieved.

It will be a big deal for me to join the group because I suffer from various learning difficulties/mental health problems and huge self conciousness and social phobia and also a lower class unemployed English person whos been knocked down my whole life and have no self esteem. But I think I might do if not the next one then eventually. 😁</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> You're very perceptive and from my point of view you've much to contribute (which is evidenced here, hehe).. it would be wonderful to have you in for our next discussion on introductions.

It's worth noting that this is only the beginning and that I personally value all sorts of contributions towards learning difficult stuff like this(and I don't think I'm the only one with such sentiment). 

I understand your social phobias to a degree as I've got my own shit to sort out on the regular (hell, all of us do to some degree with this hellscape reality we call capitalism). It's a practice, though, so we can only sharpen our wits through application.

Hell, if you only join in next time to keep us on task would be helpful for sure! Let's learn! 😁</p>

I will say, I'm more motivated just corresponding here in discord for next discussions.. imma take some notes and try real hard to actually contribute next session..  AND YOU CAN TOO COMRADE! 

This is the energy we must arouse in the proletariat, generally, if we're to contribute to the long march of human progress. We make little steps like these. 😊</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> this is the version youve got right Zack? the cambridge one

> When we give ourselves up to a sensation, a purpose, an interest, and feel restricted therein, feel unfree, then the place where we can withdraw from it back into freedom is this area of self-certainty, of pure abstraction, of thought. Or again, when we speak of things, we call their nature or essence their concept, and this concept is only for thought; but still less shall we say of the concepts of things that we dominate them, or that the thought determinations of which they are the complex are at our service. On the contrary, our thought must accord with them, and our choice or freedom ought not to want to fit them to its purposes.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Yeah, I'm working from the free Marxist org one provided from Doug.

That second translation is rather helpful.. I always have to read and re-read. Usually out loud to myself is the best way for me to internalize the idea. Not to say that that actually gets me to get closer to what it means for others, LOL.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> I was reading it as thought just more generally, as a general concept itself. I'm not trying to read too much into what Hegel might be meaning but I'm doing more surface level. I know in the past when I've read Zizek or others that have been referencing Hegel they have concepts that are predicated on further concepts so I'm not trying to do too much of that and keep it surface level.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@douglain#0</span> what do you think of this interperatation <@386755556817240065>?

in the first sentance it seems to me like hes saying we have a freedom in thought abstraction but then in the second hes talking about a kind of unfreedom or a restriction, our notions and the determinations of which they are the complex(the content?) arent under our control but yet we have to fit our freedom of thought around that fact and accommodate it, so were still free.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I finished the video off anyway and think i grasped most of what you cover kind of.

I see in it what I found in Zizek initially and what changed my life for the better. Its a remedy to the kind of nihilism that says - whats the point, were just a drop in the ocean and theres a whole dead lifeless empty space out there with nothing in it, we dont even exist ourselves, were just a mind trapped in a body thats gonna die and we'll disappear, itll be like nothing ever existed.

For one thing that dead lifeless empty space is only a subjective representation, theres nothing behind it so its like youre making it up. Theres really not some actual empty void, its purely theoretical. Also Nothing exists without our thinking it into being because existing is a concept in our minds, it doesnt mean anything without us to think it.

 I'd become completely cynical about music which I'd previously thought was the most important thing in my life that its just a fantasy, its meaningless sound but when I started hearing Zizek I realised if thats all there is, our perceptions and our fantasies then the answer lies within them which includes music and art and philosophy etc and then I realised we have a huge legacy of incredible art and thought to draw on that id never thought about before, classical music, poetry and philosophy, like the greatest minds of all time have created this edifice of work for not only escaping that nihilism but pointing out that its false. Philosophy became my kind of religion. 🤩</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I know this is quite possibly very naive and I hope to deepen my understanding of it through reading this book but thats what I'm getting on a macro level and its not just this obviously, theres way more to it, this is just the psychological benefit I get from it</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Perhaps it is naive of me to say this too, but … consider that one of the fundamental problems of philosophy (and Science) is that no one can do the job for you (“no ‘royal road’”). Maybe the subjective psychological benefit is all there ought to be to it.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@actualvargas#0</span> Maybe that’s true yeah, or at least it’s a powerful driving factor for sure. I’ve heard zizek talk about his collection of Hegels works as if he was talking about holy scripture</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Dialectics is such a great way to think when you’re in politics. Gets me away from labeling people and speculating on their inner motives.  I prefer now to just see a person who is in the process of change.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@actualvargas#0</span> I think Cutrone said about philosophy “why should we necessarily think this this way” which I read as “for what purpose do we need this philosophy”.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I also don't think it's true. Rational exploration of reality that is based on physically and externally observable phenomena is one tool by which truth can be arrived at, and more importantly, that lies can be falsified.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@douglain#0</span> <@386755556817240065> I have a small criticism of the second preface video. The bit where you have Bill murray moving about behind the text. I find bill murray extremely distracting from being able to read the text, especially as I really like Bill Murray 😄  the bit before that where the text is over a static image of a cool aerrobics lady is far more easy to concentrate on.</p>

Bill Murray dancing around was from his first appearance on the first episode of Late Night With David Letterman. He performed his version of the Olivia Newton John song on that show.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Hey Doug, when Hegel says in the Olivia Newton John bit

> We do not indeed say of our feelings, impulses or interests that they serve us, rather do they count as independent forces and powers, so that to have this particular feeling, to desire this, is what we are.® But probably we are more conscious of obeying our feelings, impulses, passions, interests, not to mention habits, than of having them in our possession, still less, in view of our intimate union with them, of their being at our disposal

Hes refering to basically unconcious thoughts. do you think hes saying this is the way it is or that this is a misunderstanding we should overcome?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Hi Thomas, first of all I admit I overreacted, claimed some wrong things and was quite insulting to you for which I apologise. To me reading this book is one of the most important things in the world, no exaggeration, and I have strong feelings about it, this doesn’t excuse my behaviour tho. I was disappointed with how the workshop turned out but then again it was the very first one and theres bound to be some teething problems also maybe I thought the purpose of the reading group was gonna be a bit more like a kind of course.

 I didn’t read much of the material or watch Doug's second video before I watched the workshop but then I wasn't a participant. I fully intended to read it myself tho. I know I said about a ‘line by line’ reading when I was arguing with Doug but I was exaggerating slightly, even tho I think that would actually be an incredibly useful and productive approach and I’m sure some people actually do that but that would have to be like a daily class. Saying all that tho there are differing levels of expertise, prior reading and knowledge levels in the group and some might not even be reading it so closely so I think there needs to be some level of interpenetration of the text. I'm gonna actually join the zoom next time I hope and thats what I would like anyway. You say "the text is available, you can read it, what's the value add?" but actually I think Hegel is EXTREMELY hard to understand for anyone and I think discussing what he actually means is of utmost importance and Id like to hear other peoples interpretations a lot.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> ;
I do understand your reference to Zizek and the stock market a bit better now but Doug was asking for a summary of the 1st preface to get everyone oriented and you lept in with some quite high level stuff and stuff from secondary sources which I admit I didn’t totally understand, some id never even heard of, and theres a place for that but in the main I think the aim is to elaborate on what Hegel is saying on his own terms to some degree first and then bring in what other connections you've made later on. What if some people havent even read much Zizek? Theyre not gonna be able to understand you. I think Doug couldve steered the conversation back to the beginning better tho himself but then as I said its the first workshop so its never gonna all go totally to plan. Maybe there shouldve been an introductory zoom call or something beforehand. Anyway sorry for overreacting.

Im just reading the more theoretical stuff you wrote in your post now anyway and Ill try and understand what youre saying and then I’ll give you my opinion. Probably be tomorrow

cheers</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@angelus888#0</span> This is my first time reading Hegel, Doug says he understands it a lot better for reading the Phenomenology. Im only doing it this way because theres a group for it</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think I'll do it after Aristotle in fact, that way I can decide if I think Hegel's logic is gold or crap.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> There is a move towards questioning and logic themselves as ways to sort out the world from that which does follow in a rational sense, from that which does not. Which implies an entire different civilisation in a sense.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I mean, saying god is freedom is a statment I'll accept but it doesn't strike me as being so different from 'the absolute is pure contingency'. However, If I steelman his argument I think that the difference is that he was emphasizing possibility against contingency (with contingency being total noise/randomness while possibility is that noise and randomness + a negative determiniation that says 'but the noise doesn't go here'). And I think that's fair except my actual difficulty then would be with Doug because while I think the words 'the absolute is pure contingency' did come out of my mouth I was trying to emphasis this pure contingency as being more the starting point (the being-in-itself) than the end --- the end I would say is perhaps that 'the absolute is pure possibility' where possibility means contingency subject to negative determination (but this is also my fault for not quite getting the difference between 'the absolute' and 'being-in-itself').</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I went back and listened to an old presentation that Chris gave in 2011 for the CPGB, and he describes how he interprets Marx.
His question "you think progress is an algorithm?" makes sense given what he said, mainly, "how would someone living in that period of time interpret computer science? Would it even be possible? And could it be a useful analogy for understanding what they meant?"

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> That threw me because I thought the first thing youd said was that the thing-in-itself was contingency not that the absolute was. I'm only just starting to find out what the absolute really means but the absolute and the thing-in-itself seem to be very different. One is subjetive and one is objective for one thing altho I can see why that would be a problematic description. Im thinking of this in terms of 'being' as being absolute.
Did you mean Being-in-itself instead of the thing-in-itself originally?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> So It seems to me that Hegel elides thing-in-itself into being-in-itself (but when he does he usually capitalizes it to Thing-in-itself) --- as in, the thing-in-itself (where 'thing' is taken not as a specific sensuous object, but rather, as the category of all things) is also being-in-itself</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> There is with "The Absolute", what the question means and what the answer is that we find, right?
What is "the absolute"? What are we even asking? Here is from the MIA Hegel GLossary:

"Absolute and Relative are philosophical terms concerning the mutual interdependence of things, processes and knowledge. ‘Absolute’ means independent, permanent and not subject to qualification. ‘Relative’ means partial or transient, dependent on circumstances or point-of-view. For dialectics, the Absolute is only the whole movement through various relative stages of understanding, but the progress of knowledge never comes to an end, so the absolute is relative. However, even a relative truth may nevertheless contain some grain of truth, so there is an absolute within the relative."

So when we talk about "The Absolute", we are asking, what is this "independent, permanent and not subject to qualification"? So for Absolute may be something like the lay term, the "ultimate", or Jasper's term "the comprehensive", the everything. 

Pure Being? What can we say about pure being? At the outset, "It is pure indeterminateness and emptiness. There is nothing to be intuited in it, if one can speak here of intuiting" (Chapter 1, first paragraph). 

I think there's a truth in what Thomas is saying about contingency or possibility, in Hegel's language, indeterminate. I think where we are disagreeing is around randomness as an adequate description, which maybe is not his position (anymore?). Freedom is not random, randomness, nor psuedo-randomness; in my opinion, randomness is only a modeling tool for the unmodelable. I don't think Hegel is interested in modeling, and that is also the problem with the stock-market metaphor, which I brought up originally as a counter-example. Modeling is empirical; what I understood from Thomas was he was staking a claim that through iterative modeling and correcting, we could get at the "thing-in-itself" of the economy; ie moving towards LTV. and thereby [tbc]</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> ...there ascertaining "metaphysical" truths, ie about the economy.

I think this whole approach misses what Hegel is intersted it, but I think we can get back to it, following it through. The idea of an algorithm attempting to ascertain the "thing-in-itself" of the economy through iterative falsification and revision, would have to include a theory of algorithmic modeling. Otherwise it would be making assumptions it is unable to revise; ie, my contention about randomness as a modelling assumption above. The algorithm would have to engage in self critique of its own methodology in response to falsifications at some point, otherwise it would be trapped within a confined set of possible theories. This is my attempt at a version of Kant's critique of empiricism. For him space & time were assumptions necessarily prior to experience. The "thing-in-itself", Hegel explains in the Introduction, is also a pure product of thought. So the algorithm, in attempting to get at "the real economy", assumes there is such a thing; assumes a thing to be modeled. Models assume quantity, quality, etc.. All which cannot be ascertained through senses or modeling.

So where do these concepts come from? How do we justify using them at all? I think that's what Hegel is developing. We go out and try to understand the world and realize we are folding it into concepts with already carry, then we need to go inward and examine these concepts and critique them. 

Where do we start? How do we develop and critique concepts without making untenable assumptions?  If we require a conceptual framework to be assumed before empirical investigation, can this conceptual framework be developed and justified within itself, independent of sensual experience? I think this is what Hegel means by speculative reason and metaphysics.

We can examine thought itself directly; whereas the world of our sense is understood through thought, through abstraction, conceptualization.  But thought is not arbitrary and has [tbc]</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> <@476561351167311872> I found your comments quite helpful here, especially towards the end when you begin asking questions about where do we start thinking about thought and how do we go about thinking about it on its own terms without bringing in unwarranted assumptions.  In a way it reminds me of what Descartes attempted in his metaphysical thinking.  Of course Hegel goes worlds beyond Descartes because while Descartes takes thinking for granted, and the brute fact of his own thinking activity as a clear indication that he can be certain at the very least that he himself exists as a thinking thing, Hegel refuses to let the brute fact of the existence of thought itself be taken for granted and that it’s foundation must be examined on its own terms.  Maybe the reference to Descartes is unwarranted but I see a similarity in his attempt to evacuate the mind as much as possible to reach some kind of foundation for mental activity and Hegel’s attempt to evacuate thought itself of all determinations to try to reach an understanding of thought itself.  

Or maybe I have no idea what I’m talking about and am completely misunderstanding the text.  I have literally spent hours trying to come up with something to contribute here and keep deleting everything I write because at a certain point it seems to get tied up in a knots and stops making sense.</p>

I spent a lot of time as a serious monestary visiting Buddhist for a while so I’ve studied the phenomenon of thought quite thoroughly.
In my experience there is the kind of thought that tends to accompany speech when there is tension. This is usually because one has not practiced gratitude for the wisdom of the Buddha or the monks and all the lay people.

I’m not sure if “where thought comes from” is what you’re driving at, but thought I’d share.</p>

I'm really glad you found my comments helpful. 
At some point I was also continually thinking of Descartes. Descartes found thought as that which cannot be doubted in its existence, whereas that of sensual reality can.
Hegel, I think, does not doubt the existence of sensual reality, but we know it only mediately through thought - I think, based on my understanding of PoS.
Hegel's interest in thought is not to prove existence, but to understand (not in his terminological sense) thought in-itself towards thought understanding itself: for itself.

I looked into Hegel's writings on Descartes: so far this quote was helpful:

"Descartes started by saying that thought must necessarily commence from itself; all the philosophy which came before this, and specially what proceeded from the authority of the Church, was for ever after set aside. But since here thought has properly speaking grasped itself as abstract understanding only, in relation to which the more concrete content still stands over on the other side, the determinate conceptions were not yet deduced from the understanding, but taken up only empirically. "

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> My understanding of Buddhist meditation is that it is a different type of self-consciousness. But idk how it is different besides seeming more "intuitive", which hegel seems to not like (still figuring out why).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Another quote on Descartes I found super helpful, hope it doesn't bother people I am posting a lot:

"The thinking subject as the simple immediacy of being-at-home-with-me is the very same thing as what is called Being; and it is quite easy to perceive this identity. As universal, thought is contained in all that is particular, and thus is pure relation to itself, pure oneness with itself. We must not make the mistake of representing Being to ourselves as a concrete content, and hence it is the same immediate identity which thought likewise is. Immediacy is, however, a one-sided determination; thought does not contain it alone, but also the determination to mediate itself with itself, and thereby — by the mediation being at the same time the abrogation of the mediation — it is immediacy. In thought we thus have Being; Being is, however, a poor determination, it is the abstraction from the concrete of thought. This identity of Being and Thought, which constitutes the most interesting idea of modern times, has not been further worked out by Descartes; he has relied on consciousness alone, and for the time being placed it in the forefront. For with Descartes the necessity to develop the differences from the ‘I think’ is not yet present; Fichte first applied himself to the deduction of all determinations from this culminating point of absolute certainty."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Buddhist meditation is about recognizing when one is thinking, rather than thinking about thinking. The training is meant to help people stay in the moment, and ultimately be so comfortable in the moment that they can enjoy the boredom and stillness of the moment.
It takes a few years to get good at it but it really does work.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The philosophy of Buddhism is about kindness. Much like Marx, Buddha and his disciples made systems of kindness that involved various things like “right action” “right speech” and meditation, which I would call the material aspect of Buddhism or, practicing kindness.

Transcendental meditation I have never done though. Buddha rejected this kind of meditation, as well as ascetic traditions and traditions of complete resignation and passivity.
Buddhism is also known as the “middle way” between these two traditions.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> So subjectivity is objectivity but objectivity is also subjectivity. Does that mean that inanimate objects have subjectivity? Like they are living thinking things like us, kind of like Alan whats says that everything has conciousness even rocks and so on.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> It means that the external world is a category of our perception. And that, when realize our subjectivity is the basis of the objective world we take up our subjectivity as objective and lose our freedom in the process. We become fixed, reified, and a product of caprice and causation. There is no material world but our consciousness is objective and fixed. We are not ghosts in a machine, there is no machine, but rather as ghosts we are as mechanical and machinelike as ever, even if we no longer have any foundation or access to truth or reality.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Hegel seems to accept Kants categorical description of perception right but he talks about it a lot more loosely, like he doesnt want to define what the categories are in such a rigid way as Kant who based them on the only 12 aristotelian categories of logic that comprised logic at the time</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@douglain#0</span> cool, would it come under substance? I've got a feeling Hegel is refering to Kants categories but I dont think he wants to limit them to only the 12 that Kant came up with because hes not happy with how kant prooved them in the trancendental deduction. I may be wrong, I think I heard it from a jumble of secondary material ive seen, maybe the Stephen Houlgate lectures.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> so maybe what im saying is it doesnt matter which Kantian category it comes under because Hegels not concerned with what exact categories there are, but Im getting ahead of where we are in the book which I know is annoying 😄</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I wanted to bring up this bit, but I kept thinking it would drag the conversation backwards a little bit. Nevertheless, here is what I think the essence, maybe, of the Science of Logic is all about.
> ~54 
> Anaxagoras is praised as the man who first declared that Nous, thought, is the principle of the world, that the essence of the world is to be defined as thought. In so doing he laid the foundation for an intellectual view of the universe, the pure form of which must be logic.
> 
> What we are dealing with in logic is not a thinking about something which exists independently as a base for our thinking and apart from it, nor forms which are supposed to provide mere signs or distinguishing marks of truth; on the contrary, the necessary forms and self-determinations of thought are the content and the ultimate truth itself.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@douglain#0</span> I'm still on my super slow read through the Greek classics from step one basically, but I have a mini comment re: Mac McManus and his views on Aristotle. I didn't listen to him for ages and ages because I wanted to get there with my own re-read and form my own opinion when I got there organically, but I think there's maybe a problem with his complaints about A.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> He seemed to be complaining about A. because seems to focus on elite glory or excellence, and he just kind of accepted this as divorced from the masses, but I'm not at all sure the Ancient Greeks at all would have thought like this.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> They maybe would have viewed it, at least some of them, as the standard to which all could rise, or a very high percentage of people, rather than something that was just sort of exclusive, superior, and very rare like your more sort of Ubermenchy-type theories.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> My evidence for this different view is basically Sparta, the concept of the Homoioi and their strange traning. Essentially they tried to make all of their citizens, this excellent kind of hero. Not that the heros were rare and you sought them out, but that with adequate training, pretty much everyone could get there.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> An insane part of my brain wants to write something about it, but Aristophane's *the Clouds* is the current landscape of media. In the Clouds, the main character, Strepsiades goes to a phrontestery or "thinkery" in order to learn from one of the many crazy schools of greek thought, all of which are insane, all of which are in contest with each other. In order to learn the argument of "wrong" which can win against "right."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Sorry I wasn't able to make it to the workshop on saturday, My sleep cycle get's flipped around occasionally and I would have been a zombie 😦 

(I was especially sad because I even read the introduction twice and took notes to prove i'd read it this time, lol). There were a few parts of the document I wished you guys had touched on --- the first bit is this: 

"Because the result, the negation, is a specific negation, it has content. It is a fresh Notion but higher and richer than its predecessor; for it is richer by the negation or opposite of the latter, therefore contains it, but also something more, and is the unity of itself and its opposite. "

This, to me, means that the first important step in dialectics relies on realizing that while there is 'contradiction' as an abstract universal, there is also the need to treat every contradiction as its own contradiction. What is more, there is also a need to understand that new contradictions contrain or enclose previous contradictions. This is what I mean when I say something like 'capitalism *is* a feudalism' or 'communism *is* a capitalism' --- or even what I meant during a far previous interview when I said 'theory *is* violence': i.e. theory sublates violence, and must contain violence if it is to be a superior contradictory stance (superior Notion). 

Next, there is an appearance of petit objet a in the text when Hegel mentions that kant shows us: "objectivity of the illusion and the necessity of the contradiction" --- i.e. that kant shows us that illusion takes on a life of its own (is objective) and contradiction is necessary. This ties into a further statement that Hegel makes where he says:</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "The philosophising which is most widespread among us does not go beyond the Kantian results, that Reason cannot acquire knowledge of any true content or subject matter and in regard to absolute truth must be directed to faith. But what with Kant is a result, forms the immediate starting-point in this philosophising, so that the preceding exposition from which that result issued and which is a philosophical cognition, is cut away beforehand. "

Here we should emphasize the *immediate starting point* of this *failure* --- that is what I mean when I say that being-in-itself is pure contingency. What Hegel is talking about here, I feel, is that there is a permanent irreducible non-relation between the thing-in-itself and our perception of it, a non-relation which enters into our perception because our perception is also a thing-in-itself. Thus towards the end we get to the bit that doug tried to touch on but which Alex seemed to reject? I would like to discuss that more because it seemed to me that Doug's reading was basically correct but maybe I don't understand Alex's objection completely.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> I dont see why being-in-itself is contingency tho. Whats your meaning of the term contingent? Do you mean that its random or abitrary? I do admit tho I dont totally understand what Hegel is saying here yet.

Also what bit are you talking about that doug was talking about and Alex rejected, could you give me a time in the video please?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> by contingent I mean something like arbitrary or random (contingent in the sense that the reason its happening is some stupid contingent reason you didn't think of that doesn't have any connection to a grand story or narrative). A better term might be non-relation or rather un-relation: i.e. a bunch of relation + some extra nonsense that can't be accounted for completely except to say that it is random or arbitrary in some sense (so even a constantly repeating pattern, like an oscillation, might be an unrelation compared to something more complicated that isn't an oscillation because the oscillation repeats constantly while the more complicated thing doesn't). Kant shows that we can't ever have access to the thing-in-itself (i.e. we can't be in direct relation to it, there is a non-relation) and Hegel says, 'ah, but that lack of relation is the relation' and that's what I mean by an 'un-relation': it returns back from non-relation like the undead return from the dead.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> by illusion is he talking about the illusion of dialectic reason? From what I've read, before Kant, dialectic meant reasoning without a foundation, so it was baseless assumptions that were argued for purely rhetorical reasons, but Kant I think elevated dialectical reasoning to having a 'semblance of truth'.

this is from the entry on dialectic in 'A Kant Dictionary' by Howard Caygill:

"His dialectic no longer offers rules for executing convincing judgements, but teaches how to detect and uncover judgements that bear a semblance of truth but are infact illusionary. It is a 'critique of dialectical illusion' and not (as previously) 'an art of producing such illusion dogmatically (an art unfortunately very commonly practiced by metaphysical jugglers)'"

and

"The illusions which Kant will criticize are not simply sophisms born of the desire to convince, but follow from the 'natural and inevitable illusion' of human reason."

Im thinking Hegel might be talking about this when he mentions illusion? And the objectivity of illusion, I'm not quite sure what he means by objective, that its not just subjective illusion but objectively true?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> This is outside of what we’ve read and what we plan to read for the workshop, but you might want to have a look at §91ff of the Encyclopedia Logic (which corresponds to section 1, chapter 2.A.bff of the SoL). There, Hegel elaborates his definition of being-in-itself as the “being of quality” vis-a-vis quality as the relation of otherness that determines being-there (Dasein, existence) (§91). At this point in the development of the immanent unfolding of thought that is Hegel’s logic, he seems to be elaborating thought’s apprehension of that which renders something to be-there (Dasein) as distinct from another, with the being-in-itself of the former its thisness as immediate determinateness, as becoming that has internalized negation as its qualifying limit.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think I follow what you mean by being-in-itself as contingency (is the following an accurate paraphrase: that it is random, or unknowable ahead of the determination, what constitutes the otherness that relates to and determines the quality of being-there?), but I am unsure whether this illuminates Hegel’s concept. On the one hand, Hegel seems to stress necessity as guiding these movements. In other words, determinateness doesn’t enter into becoming and sublate it into Dasein from just anywhere but necessarily originates from within becoming itself: “self-alteration is involved in the concept of being-there [Dasein], and is only the manifestation of what being-there is in-itself” (EL §92 149). On the other, his elaboration of being-in-itself (as the being of quality) serves to demonstrate simply a structure of thought that allows us to conceive, as he describes in the opening sentence of EL §91, the reality of being-there. To put it (perhaps too) simply, Hegel’s being-in-itself seems to refer to the moment in thought when we conceive of an object as distinct from that which it is not: the object’s being as this, distinct from another.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The real payoff of this claim seems to arrive when Hegel later defines being-for-itself as the sublation of quality, being-for-itself as the ideality of Dasein: “the truth of the finite” (EL §95, page 152) that determines becoming as existence, being-in-itself. Because we can reason the in-itself of Dasein, its reality as a distinct quality, we can in thought arrive at its truth, the for-itself: “being-for-itself has to be interpreted generally as ideality. . . . the concept of ideality expressly consists in its being the truth of reality, or in other words, reality posited as what it is in-itself proves itself to be ideality” (EL §96, page 153). I offer these thoughts with the reservation that I may have just entirely missed the larger point you’re making.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@joser__b#0</span> So paraphrase is basically accurate. However, I'm not a Heidigarrian so I don't have as strong an understanding of Dasein as some others might. I think the important thing not to stumble over is that, at least in my understanding, what is going is *the necessity of a unnecessity* --- or the necessity of contradiction. So to say 'ah but Hegel emphasizes necessity' misses the point: the necessity that Hegel is emphasizing is contradiction which both/and and thus radically open/free. To me the sublation in Hegel is this moment where we realize that it was always-already the case that this freedom was necesary from the beginning of a process, persisted through the process as free, and remains as a point of freedom even after its eventual demise/failure and then undead repitition. 

So tldr; the reason I emphasize the contingency as illuminating is precisely because the *liberal* and *right* reading of Hegel, it seems to me, wants to read Hegel as 'well he's talking about logic and determinations and necessity so that means what he's talking about is *determinism*' and that just isn't it. He's talking about the necessity of a lack of necessity and the necessary consequences of that: so a kind of determinism, but a strange one, a speculative and constantly self failing necessity.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> When Hegel uses 'objective' versus subjective, it is not an epistemology sense.
Objective does not mean "objectively true" but rather ontologically objective. It exists outside of our agency. He frequently refers to objective logic, meaning the immanent laws of thought independent of the thinker/subject.
I think in that passage on illusion he contrasts it to subject illusions, which he speaks of in the way he elsewhere talks about sophistry: the problem is not an honest mistake or a moment of thought necessarily incomplete and under illusion. Subjective illusion is based in desires other than to know the truth, and subordinating knowledge so as to create illusions.

 Objective illusion is a necessary moment; it's problem is that it is not yet recognized as illusory in Kant.

In my translation, they actually use the term "reflective shine' instead of illusion. Reflective shine is developed in chapter 2 or 3 I think</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> Dasein here is not Heidegger's existentialism. Existence is the topic of chapter two, determinate being.

I still think what you are getting at with the word contingent should be indeterminate. Determinations for Hegel are not the same as determinism of mechanical physics. Contingency as randomness or arbitrariness feels incorrect because it seems to point to causality in time and space, or a-causality, unnecessity.

Indeterminacy is a much broader concept in the realm of ontology, even prior to physical world.
Hegel develops from being to existence to .... A bunch of steps.. to develop concepts of space and time from scratch within thought. When he talks about the indeterminacy of being, he doesn't mean that being necessarily is undetermined. He means that we have a complete abstraction, with no content of thought. We have not specified any 'thing' but the mere possibility of thing-ness. Not even existence (determinate being), but pure being.

It really feels like you're wanting to skip ahead to Hegel's conclusions when we have not even gotten to his starting place.

I will agree with you and I think it's super important and insightful and I thank you.
Kant's empty concept of "thing-in-itself" is indeterminate and the radical indeterminacy which I believe helps understand why Hegel starts with being - pure, indeterminate being.
This takes the emptiness of thing-in-itself and goes further, to fully empty out the thought (not even concept, he says).

We can't yet speak of the world as it is; we are analyzing the simplest thoughts possible to develop them immanently to a system of thought capable of grounding perception and understanding of the world of our senses.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think what Joseph says about the determinate movement of thought, is very important.

In a sense, the necessity in unnecessity is inverted. 
We see the necessity out of unnecessity.

Being is immediately indeterminate, but thereby determines nothing. Nothing is immediately indeterminate, but thereby determines being.

These are the fundamental determinations of everything else. Ie, everything is, at bottom in some sense, has it's determination in the pure indeterminate</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Can you explain your understanding of the word necessity a bit please?

I found this bit very informative
“Being is immediately indeterminate, but thereby determines nothing. Nothing is immediately indeterminate, but thereby determines being.”👍</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> You think I’m off the mark tho about what I said about illusion meaning dialectical illusion? Oh actually you did say it was like sophistry which is basically what I was talking about with dialectic so maybe you agree with me.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think we agree about illusion. I just wanted to clarify the term objective in relation to it. That subjective illusion is sophistry as opposed to illusion as a stage of reflection - which I do not yet understand (it's section 2, not chapter 2, much further along).

My attempt:
Necessity - could not be otherwise. Following laws or causal patterns.

 In philosophy of history at least, necessity is opposed to accident; Hegel and plekhanov write about the dialectical unity of historical necessity and accident, ie WW1 triggered by accident but as a symptom of larger historical forces/laws.
Necessity in the (natural and historical) world is used by hegel/Marxists to mean by the laws of nature or history. 
So in the logic, necessity is following the laws of thought. In internal, inherent patterns of movement.

Does that help?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Yes that does help, I guess you could say the opposite of necessity is contingency also?

right, I think Hegel also links subjective to understanding and objective to reason although I dont quite grasp it atm and subjective is related to everyday abstract logic wheras objective is to specualtive logic.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Understanding is the way thought comprehends something. It is static; and it's development, is critique or sublation, the movement is reason.
They're both moments of thought.

I don't think subjective has the negative connotation of everyday usage. I might have misrepresented it before. He doesn't mean that subjectivity is contingent or Caprice. At the end of the introduction he refers to "misconception" of subjective as "accident" and "arbitrary".

Subjective just means it's depends on the subject or thinker.
The last third of the book is Subjective Logic. Which is when he develops the concept of concept/notion.
Last reading group I got the idea of notion all wrong; it's just an alternative translation to concept.
Concept for hegel is explicit, determinate thought. Thought which is clear to itself.
That's what makes it subjective logic. It's an achievement of 560 pages of developing thought.

I mean - I think he also uses subjective for things like intentionality. And sophistry is determined by intentionality or desire to convince, rather than thought itself or the desire for truth of thought.

So subjective can refer to determinations from without which interfere with the immanent development of thought; but subjectivity also develops from this development.

Just to say subjective is understood independent of this idea of it being problematic. It's problematic when it's premature or out of place in logic</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I'm not certain that notion just means concept --- I think that indeterminate (without difference) is an okay step in terms of what I mean when I say contingency but if it is its because I want to emphasize the underlying point which is contradiction. Contradiction is the object of pure indeterminiteness (literally, it is both a and not a, as in you can't separate out or determine the difference between oppositions). This is why I don't think 'concept' is a sufficient notion for 'notion'. My understanding is that notion is what happens when concept moves all the way to the point of understanding the necessity of a contradiction in the operation of the object under consideration with 'Notion' (capital 'N', the Notion) being the historical and transcendental movement of contradiction itself. (also, the reason I focus on randomness and contingency is because both are important forms of contradiction which I think are ignored by a lot of theorists, not the best theorists, but a lot of simpler readings, and I'm a scientist so its especially important for my work).

I also thinking its fun, with that sentence 'being is indeterminate and therefore determines nothing, nothing is indeterminate and therefore determines being' to read it this way: 'being is indeterminate and therefore determines contradiction, contradiction is indeterminate and therefore determines being' --- and also to swap out contingency sometimes for this nothing-contradiction. The reason being that it gets to the deeper point, I feel, which is that, in a dialectical system, what is truly 'stripped out' of reality is only contradiction itself and what separates out a metaphysics from a dialectics is the demand that we strip something more than contradiction out of reality.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@douglain#0</span> Last night I was reading the Encyclopedia Logic which seems to have a much more explanation building up to the starting point, and he discussed what he means by metaphysics. A lot things which were previously unclear to me became clear. By metaphysics, he means getting the truth/essence/self of things; what Kant cut off by calling it "unknowable thing-in-itself", right. Previously,

"The Metaphysic of the past assumed, as unsophisticated belief always does, that thought apprehends the very self of things, and that things, to become what they truly are, require to be thought."

As I write this, it seems almost banal. But what felt clear is the sense of an "essence", the core aspect of a thing. I think this is a difficult concept only because modern thought has abandoned it or at least has deep skepticism about the possibility of ever knowing it (Kantian). I think this it the link - also going back to last discussion - between is and ought - both within the logic (how it moves) and how it applies to political problems. Personally, this has reenergized my desire to understand all this. The Kantian conclusion - and overall modernist assumption - that we cannot know essences because of the mediation of appearance, is falsified in thought. If we can understand the essence of thought itself, we know correct from incorrect thought, we can know truth of thought. 

"The forms of thought must be studied in their essential nature and complete development: they are at once the object of research and the action of that object. Hence they examine themselves: in their own action they must determine their limits, and point out their defects. This is that action of thought, which will hereafter be specially considered under the name of Dialectic, and regarding which we need only at the outset observe that, instead of being brought to bear upon the categories from without, it is Immanent in their own action."

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> I'm curious why you consider it "deeper" to change out 'contradiction' with 'nothing'?  Similarly, you say "underlying point", as though its more fundamental. In what sense is it?

I don't follow what you're saying by "Contradiction is the object of pure indeterminateness". I don't think this is the same as what Hegel means by "indeterminateness"; contradictions are determined in the two sides, the two objects or aspects in the contradiction. Contradiction is necessarily determinate, it cannot stand on its own, it is contradiction of/in something.

I also do not see how randomness nor contingency are forms of contradiction.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> So the 'deeper' point here, and I may be being a Zizekian in this interpretation, is that contradiction is the *only* thing which it is to be nothing, every other determinate thing or description of nothing beyond contradiction is immediately something, and the problem with what Marxists call metaphysics (which is based in Hegelian philosophy, but which is both more developed and misdeveloped in Marxism) is the tendency to want to add foreclosures to contradiction --- i.e. strip out non-contradictions from reality, i.e. engage in 'realism'. That's the 'deeper' point. 

What's more, it is a 'necessary illusion' to say that a contradiction is determined in its two sides (object and anti-thesis) --- That's what a contradiction appears as from the perspective of reality: as the 'collision' or 'oscillation about', or 'dynamical tension' or 'random noise out of' a particular concrete object in 'reality' as the object attempts to be both 'a' and 'not a' in some way. In that sense, once a particular contradiction is embodied in reality then it takes on this distinct form... but 'The Contradiction' (capital 'T' capital 'C') is not so differentiated, the thing behind the things, is an indeterminate no-thing and this is how I read that nothing, i.e. no-thing, i.e. contradiction determines being (i.e. reality). 

Random noise is an instance of the the contradiction of contradiction, its the first moment of an object which is both a contradiction (moves between various opposing points, now the value is 10.21, now its 7.39, not its 15.392, etc.) and not a contradiction (i.e. there is no smoth gaurunteed oscillation between any number of particular points, in fact it could just randomly repeat 10.21 over and over forever and still be generated by a random process that just happened to come up all 10.21).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> Ok this seems to be an eccentric take on things, it seems to me you might be conflating terms from different fields that might not be equivalent actually. So theres a Contradiction big C? 2 types of contradiction? hmm. Does Hegel think there are 2 meanings of contradiction in this text? You may be on to something, maybe not I dont know and I do want to understand Zizek etc but I think its a distraction from what were trying to achieve in this reading ATM and doesnt contribute anything useful at this time. Im kind of doing 2 things at once, trying to read Zizek to understand you and trying to go back to ancient and pre-Hegelian philosophy to understand Hegel and I think the later is the most pressing for this group. TBH Ill probably keep reading the Zizek stuff too tho just cos I want to see whether theres something to what youre saying but I kind of wish youd park your contingency/contradiction-is-nothing stuff for a bit and get involved in the group, or if you really think it is directly applicable to what were doing then clarify it for us and where in the text this is.

Like for example you talk about the 'necessary illusion' that Hegel mentions. What is your understanding of what that means? This is something Hegel has taken from Kant right? What does this mean in Kantian terms? Do you know?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Sorry the phrase is 'objectivity of the illusion and the necessity of the contradiction' (I messed that up)

So yeah that's something Hegel says about Kant. For me the necessity of contradiction is the necessity of contradiction as an explanation for why there are things at all (i.e. the exclusion of contradiction means the exclusion of nothing from reality --- that's the necessity here: nothing-contradiction is excluded from reality and therefore there are things). Kant showed that we always stumble back into this contradiction/nothing and thus that it is necessary: Hegel is going to apply the contradiction to itself and show that it is also the case that there are contradictions of contradiction that necessarily produce objects. For me this is the 'let there be light' moment contained in the first chapter. 

The objectivity of illusion: here I take this to mean that while there is solipsism, the very fact that there is solipsism means that there is a necessessity to illusion: that objects themselves don't quite know what they're doing. There are many possible interpretations of this but basically if your physicist minded it would mean that an atom doesn't know its own future as much as the person looking at the atom doesn't know the future (that is, the misapprehension of reality extends into reality itself, is not merely a subjective phenomenon).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> From what I see what Hegel means by the 'objectivity of the illusion' is that the so called illusion isnt only in reason as Kant thought but, as his own philosophy actually vindicated (unbeknownst to himself according to Hegel), the contradiction is actually in the object itself as well and therefore isnt an illusion either. I think the way Hegel is using the word illusion might be misleading because he doesnt actually think its an illusion, only Kant did.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> 'necessity of contradiction' is more difficult for me but the word necessity for Kant and Hegel has a definate meaning and isnt just used vaguely to mean 'is necessay for this or that'. It means its necessary for our common sense understanding of the world to be true and therefore must be known a priori. I think he means that contradiction is necessary and therefore known a priori, as or part of a category of the understanding.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> from here https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hegel-dialectics/
> Hegel adopts Kant’s dialectical conception of reason, but he liberates reason for knowledge from the tyranny of the understanding. Kant was right that reason speculatively generates concepts on its own, and that this speculative process is driven by necessity and leads to concepts of increasing universality or comprehensiveness. Kant was even right to suggest—as he had shown in the discussion of the antinomies—that reason is dialectical, or necessarily produces contradictions on its own. Again, Kant’s mistake was that he fell short of saying that these contradictions are in the world itself. He failed to apply the insights of his discussion of the antinomies to “things in themselves” (SL-M 56; SL-dG 35; see also section 4). Indeed, Kant’s own argument proves that the dialectical nature of reason can be applied to things themselves. The fact that reason develops those contradictions on its own, without our heads to help it, shows that those contradictions are not just in our heads, but are objective, or in the world itself. Kant, however, failed to draw this conclusion, and continued to regard reason’s conclusions as illusions. Still, Kant’s philosophy vindicated the general idea that the contradictions he took to be illusions are both objective—or out there in the world—and necessary. As Hegel puts it, Kant vindicates the general idea of “**the objectivity of the illusion and the necessity of the contradiction which belongs to the nature of thought determinations”** (SL-M 56; cf. SL-dG 35), or to the nature of concepts themselves.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Yes, I agree with that witht he proviso that we have to remember that this negation includes the thesis: what we call illusion or subjective illusion is an instance of the contradiction appearing in the object itself (i.e. in the subject) and then hegel says 'ah but that also applies to objects as well as subjects'.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> I don't think that takes it far enough, that it leaves it in the realm of epistimology: or at least one could read what you're saying that way... I read it as saying that ontologically the conradiction must ex-sist (exist... but not in reality, as the gap within reality) in order for reason to function as it does.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@douglain#0</span> Yes I watched it twice, once on 0.75 speed. I thought it was meant to be more theory heavy this time, Did you change your mind? I liked your explanation of Kent’s categories. Also very interesting about Eisenstein’s dialectical approach to film. To be honest I’m not sure what the connection was to with what should the science begin but I haven’t read all of it yet, I read very slowly because I like to be sure I understand it all.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> I had thought it would be more theory heavy but while writing I decided to just clarify one key concept about the reality of thought. Science should begin with the reality of logic I think. And at the end of the first introduction he explains that at the beginning of study the system of logic must be studied as an abstract while accepting that it will feel as though what one learns has no significance. Like learning grammar, learning logic will seem arbitrary and a matter of mere memorization, until one has the "experience of a lifetime" behind you will you see that logic is connected to living reality just as grammar is an product of a living linguistic culture.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Hegel points out that one of the categories of understanding is existence or being itself, and that we are in a peculiar position of knowing that our thoughts exist are in this sense true even as we also know that they are also at the same time necessarily unreal and without existence. Our thoughts exist as true things because being is a category of our understanding, but they are also necessarily unreal due to the same category of our understanding called being.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@douglain#0</span> I’ll just add a passing comment that our thoughts are no more or less unreal than anything else we perceive because they are all under the category of existence, so to say we are just a ghost in a machine privileges the machine as being more real than our subjectivity. I think this really challenges the idea of nihilism. Products of the mind are no less real than so called material objects. Would you agree with that?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I feel like the problem of the beggining of the science tho is that the beggining is actually the end product of the logic so to know where to begin is to have already completed the logic in a way. Hegel says the beggining and the principle of philosophy are, or should be, the same but finding the principle is exactly the end goal of the project itself.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I kind of feel like we're treating Hegel like Aristotle or some ancient Greek mystic.
I'm not sure Hegel is really concerned about the nature or phenomenon of thought, but rather how the "new" revolutionary subject ought to think about themselves and how they should begin thinking about their actions.
This seems to be what Cutrone keeps repeating in all of his podcast appearances.

I think if you're interested in what thought "is" or where it comes from, you should just take up Buddhism or mindfullness, because you would need a keen sense of awareness to really observe yourself.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Well, he's writing about Kant, and Kant completely did away with metaphysics.
So, as Cutrone would say, Hegel is beyond it.
He's not interested in why we think, or where logic begins per se, he's more interested in the dialectical process of thought and dialog between these new bougey subjects in the cities and universities.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Ancient metaphysics had in this respect a higher conception of thinking than is current today. For it based itself on the fact that the knowledge of things obtained through thinking is alone what is really true in them, that is, things not in their immediacy but as first raised into the form of thought, as things thought. Thus this metaphysics believed that thinking (and its determinations) is not anything alien to the object, but rather is its essential nature, or that things and the thinking of them — our language too expresses their kinship — are explicitly in full agreement, thinking in its immanent determinations and the true nature of things forming one and the same content.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Cutrone's interpretation of Hegel may be correct. But the way to determine that is through Hegel's text.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> So Cutrone famously says a couple interesting things that make people in my party go "hmmm":
1. When Marx says Capital, he means people.
2. It's all about Freedom(this is not that controversial lol)
3. He critiques the debate between materialism and idealism as being vulgar(as does platypus)

From this, and from what you just wrote, my guess is that the "object" isn't, like, an apple, but rather a person. And this makes it true.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Ya totally.
But the working class political parties in Germany at the time that Hegel wrote this were dealing with new political problems. We don't need Cutrone to understand this.
What I would image Hegel's science of logic is dealing with is how they go about solving problems and disputes properly? Or am I just skipping Hegel and going straight to Marx?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Well, all I really wanted to address in my initial comment, and I think rightly so, is that there's a difference between thought and logic. For logic's sake, does it matter where thought comes from? Does it come from material reality, or how we interact with material reality ultimately? Maybe both?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Now whatever may have been accomplished for the form and content of philosophy in other directions, the science of logic which constitutes metaphysics proper or purely speculative philosophy, has hitherto still been much neglected. What it is exactly that I understand by this science and its standpoint, I have stated provisionally in the Introduction.

The fact that it has been necessary to make a completely fresh start with this science, the very nature of the subject matter and the absence of any previous works which might have been utilised for the projected reconstruction of logic, may be taken into account by fair-minded critics, even though a labour covering many years has been unable to give this effort a greater perfection. The essential point of view is that what is involved is an altogether new concept of scientific procedure.

Philosophy, if it would be a science, cannot, as I have remarked elsewhere, borrow its method from a subordinate science like mathematics, any more than it can remain satisfied with categorical assurances of inner intuition, or employ arguments based on grounds adduced by external reflection. On the contrary, it can be only the nature of the content itself which spontaneously develops itself in a scientific method of knowing, since it is at the same time the reflection of the content itself which first posits and generates its determinate character. ®</p>

That said, don't we need to evaluate Hegel from his position in history, rather than assuming that he would try and re-write all of philosophy?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Point well taken. I'm totally on board.
I use Cutrone as a guide to learning Marxism. He's not really all emcompassing or a good substitution(I mean, pretty much everything he's ever said in the last year is in the maniphesto - all 30 little pages of it), but a much needed guide for the beginner-autodidacte

But I fear that in reading philosophy it's tempting to think that the phenomenon of thought is something Hegel is concerned with. I don't think it really is.
I would also say that Buddhist philosophy is, and has described it much better than any philosopher I've ever heard of, albeit admittedly mystical. It even has an exercise for this: meditation.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Is there something universal about suffering and tension as a product of thought? Yes, of course.
So, can we think our way out of this mess? Yes, but where we end up may not be the utopia of our dreams, but rather the next contradiction. Which is fine.
If Buddhism teaches anything it's that the deeper you go, the more you get out of it.

The utility of Hegel is in why he thinks we ought to re-examine the science of logic as we are, not as detached beings from the world, am i right?</p>

On the other I do see the necessity of using enlightenment thinking to analyze enlightenment thinkers(this is the Ashley coming out).</p>

> 'In so many respects', says Aristotle in the same context, 'the nature of man is in bondage; but this science, which is not studied for its utility, is the only absolutely free science and seems therefore to be a more than human possession.' Philosophical thinking in general is still concerned with concrete objects — God, nature, spirit; but logic is concerned only and solely with these thoughts as thoughts, in their complete abstraction. For this reason it is customary, to include logic in the curriculum of youth, for youth is not yet involved in the practical affairs of life, living at leisure so far as they are concerned; and it is only for its own subjective ends that it has to busy itself with acquiring the means to enable it to become actively engaged with the objects of those practical interests — and still theoretically even with these. Contrary to Aristotle's view just mentioned, the science of logic is included in these means; the study of logic is a preliminary labour to be carried out in school and it is not until later that the serious business of life and the pursuit of substantial ends begins.

I would say he's not interested in where a thought comes from, but rather how to interrogate the thinking behind the thought.

Although it would seem he wrote another book that might care about how thoughts arise. Maybe he does care about the mist, or the bubbles that flow upwards from the river of consciousness?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@douglain#0</span> in some ways isn't the understanding itself actually 'not' about thinking? isn't it more about immediate intuition? The categories allow us to intuit things immediately like this rose is red, there doesn't seem to be any thinking involved there. I think reason is more on the side of thinking as it mediates the understanding.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@douglain#0</span> > Like learning grammar, learning logic will seem arbitrary and a matter of mere memorization, until one has the "experience of a lifetime" behind you will you see that logic is connected to living reality just as grammar is an product of a living linguistic culture. 
The "Living Linguistic Culture" stuff becomes so insane at times as to forget what language is and does. It's a communication vehicle for thoughts, the language itself is constructed out of sounds, represented in images, that at first describe very ordinary physical realities that are shared referents between interlocutors. Later, these become somewhat, but not entirely, abstracted. The more they become abstracted the more difficult communication becomes, because the signal you are sending, whether written or oral, may become unreadable by the recipient. So there is a material basis to language.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Looking forward to watching the workshop when it gets posted.  I finally just watched the Henson video and as a matter of sheer coincidence had immediately before that been watching Eisenstein’s “Strike”.  Maybe it has something to do with the logical structure of The Absolute? 🙃 I will have to read his essay on the dialectical nature of film sometime.  The section of Doug’s video covering his ideas on the subject helped illuminate something about Hegel that I’d been having a hard time articulating, basically that just like a film is not a series of unrelated images one after another but a sequence of images “on top of one another” or in each others afterimage bringing a sense of coherence behind the images that need not necessarily actually be there so too our perceptions of the world are not disjointed and unrelated but seem to have a coherence the more we try to understand them even thought that coherence maybe only be a function of our perception rather than an aspect of reality in itself.  And it seems to me the overall point is that to ask about reality in itself is to miss the point, the fact that our thought requires some sort of coherent structure from the outset is the point we need to grasp.  If they makes sense 😅. Anyway looking forward to watching the workshop!</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I also had a lot of fun, but there are some things I forgot to bring up that I really should have in my discussion with Thomas:

About paraconsistent logic I think it's really important to note that linear logic is paraconsistent:

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/paraconsistent+logic#linear_logic

"Thus, both ways to deduce ex contradictione quodlibet founder precisely on the finer analysis of connectives provided by linearity. From a linear point of view, one could say that ex contradictione quodlibet arises from a failure to appreciate that ⊕ is different from ⅋, and that 0 is different from ⊥."

Why is that important? Well, it really looks like linear logic is the enigmatic "quantum logic" that people sought after:

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quantum+logic#LinearLogicAndDependentLinearTypeTheory

Urs Schreiber even uses this for a description of quantum computing dependent on classical interactions:

https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02382

So my defense of paraconsistent logics was actually way weaker than it should have been, because it really seems paraconsistent logic is at the heart of quantum theory.


The other thing is about the nature of the empty set and the one-element set/category/type, which we both identify with pure nothing and being respectively: for one, even in normal set theory one couldn't just remain with the one-element set, as in particular the operation of forming power sets, which I'd say is the most essential operation in set theory, immediately generates the empty set as an element of the power set of the one-element set. So no, even in normal set theory you can't remain with the one-element set.

Within category theory/homotopy type theory though, it becomes even more obvious that the one-object type is more essential, as, even if we just start with the empty type, the equality of that type to itself is a structure, namely the one-object type. In more prosaic terms…</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Even if we assume that nothing exists, nothing is equal to itself, and that equality is something, so something has to exist.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> So I think I'll work backwards --- the first problem I have is with the appeal to the power set, this is an assumptive foundational move of set theory? But then you have to assume you can make power sets to escape, there is nothing in a set of one object, sans access to the powerset, that gives you another object. 

I think that linear logic is really nice. If given access to infinite duplications we collapse back into classical logic (i.e. if we decide that we can, in fact, clone things, we have classical logic back and contradiction becomes one thing) --- however as long as we maintain that we aren't going to duplicate things infinitely we are left with a logic where contradiction is both ground *and* limited in its ability to produce outcomes along a particular computational path (but if we are dealing with infinite resources we get the explosion back). This paraconsistent logic is nice because it limits things in a way that doesn't limit them (i.e. we can have classical logic and eat it too, as it were).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> "the first problem I have is with the appeal to the power set, this is an assumptive foundational move of set theory?" 

Yes, having the ability to form power sets/objects is what distinguishes set-like from other objects: one can form products, coproducts and any other limits and colimits of abelian groups, for instance, as well as even function spaces between them. What makes sets so powerful is that one can classify their subsets by propositions that are true on them. This classification of subsets through truth of propositions is equivalent to the existence of power sets. But even without that one can generate all sets by forming arbitrary coproducts, meaning disjoint sums in set-theoretic jargon, from the one-element set. This is somewhat tautological as forming those arbitrary coproducts requires index sets over which they can be formed, but using just generation by binary coproducts gives you all finite sets except the empty set. In category-theoretic terms binary coproducts are a categorification of simple sums a + b, and indeed the natural numbers with addition are a decategorification of the category of finite sets with binary coproducts, corresponding to the simple intuition that forming a coproduct of two sets conists of adding the elements of those sets into another one. Note that the empty set is not generating anything under coproducts, nor under products (which correspond to multiplication], rather it acts like the categorification of zero that it is: it is the neutral element of the coproduct and it trivializes every object to itself through the cartesian product.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> That only holds in ZFC though. Use ETCS (https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/ETCS) and the generating element is the point. Use homotopy type theory and it is the point as well. In naive set theory you just assume every set exists. You can really disentangle the question from set theory completely and just look at the natural numbers: it is true that you obtain all natural numbers by applying the successor operation to 0, but the successor operation is just taking out the thing that comes after the previous thing. There is no reason to assume such a thing exists. Basically, ZFC is built on the postulate that it does. Meanwhile, if you take 1 you can obtain all other positive natural numbers through adding it to itself. Why should the sum of 1's exist? Well, it's kind of what distinguishes 1 from 0 that one is a the first non-neutral element under addition, so it is somewhat intrinsic to the nature of 1 itself. The existence of 1 also insures that the successor operation exists, since then it is given by +1. So at best it is a wash between addition and the successor operation. But while the metaphysics of addition are completely clear (take pure being and add several instances of it), those of "the successor of nothing/next to nothing" are not clear at all. Why would it exist?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> It is also not clear at all how ZFC should relate to the physical universe. It is clear for naive set theory (every collection of objects in the universe is a set) and it is clear to me for homotopy type theory (the physical universe is an object in something like an (∞, 1)-topos), but for ZFC there is no reason to assume a connection at all. Note that no collection of objects in the physical universe is a set in ZFC! It is a purely mathematical structure.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> It should exist because it ex-sists, because its a wrapper over contradiction (which is the case for all these values that are isomorphic to zero like point, empty set, null, etc.) These are all the ground that forms the basis of 'possibility' in the respective systems as an opposition to impossibility. (i.e. ultimately because nothing is only ever exactly equal to a contradiction/a contradiction equals nothing, thus nothing is impossible/can't ever actuall exist but must ex-sist as an excluded object).

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> That's a lot of claims! Let's go through them:

"it should exist because it ex-sists"

that's the kind of wordplay that I'm really skeptical of because it hides more than it reveals.

"because its a wrapper over contradiction"

that says a little more, but what does it mean? I also feel like contradiction is becoming a god-like entity being simultaneously responsible for everything and wrapped over by the empty set. I always thought it was a logical concept, but what do I know? Alright, I'll turn down the snark.

"(which is the case for all these values that are isomorphic to zero like point, empty set, null, etc.)" 

Except the point is *not* isomorphic to the empty set. Let's think of it in a simple setup: a point in a vector space V is an element of that vector space (in a set-theoretic setting), which is equivalent to a function * → V from the *one-element* set to V. Thus, *the* point in Set is the one-element set. More generally, in every category of structures without distinguished elements the point is always the terminal object while the initial object in "geometric/set-like" structures functions like the empty set. A point is also 0-dimensional, unlike the empty set, which functions like its dimension is negative infinity. It has nothing in it, thus it is not even 0-dimensional.

"ultimately because nothing is only ever exactly equal to a contradiction/a contradiction equals nothing"

It is not though. But I'm trying understand this. It is true that in classical logic, which we've already established we can't assume if we want to understand quantum theory, a contradiction implies  that every possible sentence is true. But lots of sentences aren't true if we take the empty set as a model, such as "something exists". In any case, these are logical implications, not equalities.

"thus nothing is impossible/can't ever actuall exist but must ex-sist as an excluded object"

Since it is not inconsistent as a model I don't see any reason nothing shouldn't exist…</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> even in classical logic. Generally speaking, "nothing" i.e. the empty set i.e. an initial object can be identified with the truth value of falsity for a variety of reasons. In that sense I could see that in a non-paraconsistent logic it cannot follow that falsity is true, which does follow from contradiction, thus falsity *as a truth* value cannot be true in a theory that should have any models. However, that is distinct from using the empty set as a model.

"Though, I realized after we spoke that in a lot of these systems the real point is that the system itself is the ultimate grounding object and the zero isomorphism is implied by the system for it to make any sense as a system."

Alright, to interpret this as best as I can, a foundational system, such as ZFC, ETCS or homotopy type theory (Hott) is used as a grounding for all of mathematics (and in Badiou all of everything), thus it has to be isomorphic to zero since zero is the grounding for everything. Except that the last part is what is to be established.

"(or else the system becomes incomplete and thus ends up implying zero anyway:"

All of these systems are incomplete, otherwise they would violate Gödel's incompleteness theorem. But what does completeness have to do with anything?

"without the empty set there are no sets and hence there is no reason for set theory"

Except that I gave you several ways to generate all sets from, say, the one-element set.

"without zero, multiplication doesn't make sense"

That's an odd statement. You can do multiplication just fine without ever touching zero, just using the positive natural numbers. Zero is important for *addition* because it's its neutral element. Why start with multiplication. I'm assuming because zero cancels everything out when multiplying which is important for some reason in your philosopy, but it's not something particularly useful when doing multiplication…</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "and thus addition doesn't make sense and thus numbers don't make sense,"

People have been adding and multiplying long before zero became used in number systems. Again, it's formally important to have a neutral element under addition in a variety of ways but you can do most elementary stuff without it.

"without a point there is no way to contuct any geometrical objects, and thus geometry doesn't make sense, etc)."

Again, the point is not equivalent to zero. 

"(Also contradiction of zero --- it is both positive and negative and it is neither positive nor negative, i.e. it takes on properties of both sides, or not, depending upon the context in a manner designed to squeeze the most from the contradiction of positive and negative without actually making that contradiction immanent or immediate)."

Again, a contradiction is a logical concept. There can be a thing in the middle of two other things without any contradiction implied whatsoever.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> I guess I'll have to go through line by line as well:

Ex-sists is a word that Zizek borrows from someone else in 'Less than Nothing' --- it means, at least far as I can tell, that there is some object which is necessarily false and/or partial for other objects to exist. I.e. it isn't about 'existing' things (this thing doesn't exist, in normal reality as a total complete object) but rather it must ex-sists, be excluded. 

For myself (and I suspect Zizek, but who knows)  Contradiction is a precisely god like entity --- i.e. God is a contradiction, God is nothing, God ex-sists, God doesn't exist.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> Sorry, point is isomorphic in that it has no measure, however this is a sidetrack that proves my point at a large scale even as it it proves I'm not perfect at a small scale (:D) --- i.e. the fact that point is being/terminal point just points to how being and nothing are both contradictory (i.e. point appears as zero like object because its isomorphic to 1, not zero and 1, of course, has a whole host of contradictory properties as well as zero, not the least of which is the fact that it is neither prime, nor composite, and its both prime and composite under various conditions and various situations: i.e. to make it into neither you have to claim it as a kind of weird exception in the definition so the math is pretty and perfect + an ugly gross exception don't look over here).

My point with the whole nothing is a contradiction and contradiction is nothing is simply that... that's what nothing is, even in quantum theory the whole point of the multiverse theory is that everything which isn't nothing exists, and nothing is the meeting point of all these things (the contradiction of superposition is a real nothing until you entangle with it, until then these thing don't actually have a pinned down value)... If we take the empty set as a starting point the sentence 'something exists' is true --- because there exists a power-set of the empty set (i.e. the set with just the empty set). I think that the missing point here is that implications become part of the original object: that is the 'a is not a' that is missing, that an apple isn't just a stupid fleshy apple but also the apple tree that grows from implicitly from its seeds. You have to include these implications because possibility is inherent in the object *as a possibility* (i.e. it is a property of apples that they can possibly grow into trees, this possibility function is a way for inconsistent systems to avoid their contradiction and re-cohere themselves and have things both ways).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> It is possible to have falsity as a truth value: as possibility (that is what true falsity looks like).

Zero as contradictory would need to be shown, but the point is that the only way to show it would be by tying it to every other object in the space like the empty set in set theory (however if I come up with an addition space, zero as ground does make sense in that union with the empty set is an identity operation same as addition with zero). In set theory at least, I think we can say that the empty set is + ZFC is a ground.

What I mean by it implying zero is that usually there is some kind of what I would call a *prohibition* on thought occuring to stop us from discovering zero, otherwise it is directly implied by the system. By this I mean you can of course come to me and say 'I give you only 1 and +1 as objects, you can have the number 1 and you can add 1 to it and that's it). And then I can spin my wheels generating all the natural numbers however there is nothing stopping me, outside of your demand that these be the only two things, from using symmetry after I've calculated the first infinity or so numbers, from saying 'hey, maybe there is a symmetry here' and eventually ending up with zero. In that sense I can't even do *addition* without finding zero at some point (though I admit it seems it took western mathematics nearly 10k years to actually discover zero so...)</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> As for Goedel's incompleteness theorem, yes they all have to be incomplete, which isn't a problem: in fact its a positive good as far as I'm concerned. Incompleteness implies the truth of falsity, i.e. possibility, i.e. one of the primal contradictions hiding in all objects (that you claim you have an object, a whole object, and yet you need a little bit more of the object to be able to recognize the object as such, i.e. its incomplete).

And finally I think the final statement is the point that isn't translating: all of these things other things (being in between two things, oscillating between two things, randomly jumping between things) these all speak to a contradiction that ex-sists: is excluded. My point isn't that zero is *directly* a contradiction but rather that it is a wrapper around a contradiction: it is the closest thing to what it would be for something to be both positive and negative (where positive and negative are taken as absolute logical opposites, which is what they happen to be). It is an exception to a universal (the universal being 'all numbers are either positive or negative') that exists precisely because there is a contradiction behind all the numbers that they are excluding and the weld point in reality of that exclusion is 0.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> I'm not surprised this comes from Zizek. Honestly, it might as well come from Badiou himself, I'm sure he'd like it.

"Sorry, point is isomorphic in that it has no measure"

Well, sure, you can introduce an equivalence relation on objects that identifies them if they have the same measure, then a point *in the real line* has no measure. But, by the same measure, all the natural numbers have no measure. While a line in two-dimensional space has no measure, and any finite-dimensional object in an infinite-dimensional space has zero measure. So I guess it's all isomorphic to zero, rendering all of mathematics meaningless. Strangely, we can still do mathematics though… find the error.

"the fact that point is being/terminal point just points to how being and nothing are both contradictory"

Not  a contradiction. What it is is a unity of opposites in the sense of Lawvere:

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Aufhebung

This is what I don't get about you Badiouians: Lawvere treated some of the same material, but much more meaningfully and formally stringent! Yet, the kids are running after Badiou/Zizek because he's the hip new thing while the only people who remember Lawvere are, funny enough, category theorists!

"not the least of which is the fact that it is neither prime, nor composite, and its both prime and composite under various conditions and various situations: i.e. to make it into neither you have to claim it as a kind of weird exception in the definition so the math is pretty and perfect + an ugly gross exception don't look over here)."

Except it isn't: 1 is a unit in a ring: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_(ring_theory) Units in rings are fairly well-understood and not at all ugly exceptions but integral parts of the structure. In other words, what makes 1 not a prime number is that it is *invertible*. It just looks weird if you only know the natural numbers because it is the only unit in the ring of natural numbers.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "even in quantum theory the whole point of the multiverse theory is that everything which isn't nothing exists,"

Well, everything which is physically possible, with perhaps the physical constants and maybe even some laws varying over For everything that is actually possible to exist you have to have a much more encompassing mathematicism that you really have to base on category theory. different dimensions, but the basics are actually assumed to be constant. This is quite a bit more restrictive than "everything which isn't nothing". For instance, assuming M-theory is correct and spacetime is 11-dimensional, no "parallel universe" (though I don't love that term because it's actually part of the same universe, just a bit up or down in another dimension) could have more than 11 dimensions. If everything that is possible is supposed to exist you have to assume a mathematicism that only really works with category theory.

"and nothing is the meeting point of all these things"

Well, no, even if we assume that everything that is possible exists, the meeting point is that they all *exist*.

"the contradiction of superposition is a real nothing until you entangle with it"

Well, no, because if something exists in a state of superposition it *still exists* and *is something*, actually several things, but not *nothing*. This is actually practically relevant because in quatum computers you use that the particles involved exist in a state of superposition, meaning they take on every *physically possible* configuration, but they're still something, they don't disappear and don't even take on physically impossible configurations.

"If we take the empty set as a starting point the sentence 'something exists' is true --- because there exists a power-set of the empty set (i.e. the set with just the empty set)."

What you're saying here is that, if we assume the empty set exists in the set-theoretic universe and assume the usual set-theoretic axioms, we can derive the other sets…</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> but in that case you're assuming the empty set exists *as an object of the surrounding universe*. What I'm saying is that, first of all, you can take any other set as well, but more importantly, you can also assume that nothing exists *in your universe*, meaning *no object exists in your universe*, meaning your universe *is* but does not *contain* the empty set, meaning it itself is a model, and this model is consistent and doesn't fulfill sentences like "something exists".

"I think that the missing point here is that implications become part of the original object: that is the 'a is not a' that is missing" 

Except that we actually have a way of conveying that: the sentence "a has the possibility to become b", which is different from saying "a is not a". Nothing contradictory about it.

"It is possible to have falsity as a truth value: as possibility (that is what true falsity looks like)."

Of course that is possible, what I'm saying is you can't have a consistent theory from which it follows that falsity is true. 

"but the point is that the only way to show it would be by tying it to every other object in the space like the empty set in set theory"

Well, sure, every object in a category derives its properties from every other object, but that isn't something special to zero.

"In set theory at least, I think we can say that the empty set is"

sure, just as we can say that every other set is.

" + ZFC is a ground."

Again, the metaphysics of ZFC aren't clear at all. Why would it have any relation at all to our physical universe? It is a purely mathematical structure. 

"What I mean by it implying zero is that usually there is some kind of what I would call a prohibition on thought occuring to stop us from discovering zero"

I don't see at all why zero would be harder to think than, say,  ב one (there is however a prohibition to sanely using Hebrew letters in Discord, apparently), the cardinality of the continuum…</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "I can't even do addition without finding zero at some point"

Sure, because it is a mathematical object. What's under discussion is whether it enjoys an ontologically prior status to, particularly, 1.

"Incompleteness implies the truth of falsity"

*No it doesn't!* People keep using Gödel's incompleteness theorems as if they imply some sort of contradiction within mathematics, but they *decidedly* don't. What they state is that any formal theory powerful enough to do arithmetic in cannot prove its own consistency within itself unless it is inconsistent (in which case one can prove anything in it). This does *not* imply falsity, in fact it gives you exact conditions a system has to fulfill to avoid implying falsity.

"that you claim you have an object, a whole object, and yet you need a little bit more of the object to be able to recognize the object as such"

One step at a time: Gödel's incompleteness theorems are about mathematical theories, not objects. They do provide limits to what you can discover about all objects fulfilling the theory in question without assuming a more powerful background theory, in that sense they are elementary logical contstraints, but *they do not imply that it follows for those theories that they imply the truth of falsity*.

"all of these things other things (being in between two things, oscillating between two things, randomly jumping between things) these all speak to a contradiction that ex-sists: is excluded."

So it exists but doesn't exist but it is also responsible for every edge case and everything that has several properties and also everything that isn't completely stationary (how can it do that if it doesn't exist?). But what then is the explanatory power of any of it? It isn't about logical contradictions, because those aren't logical contradictions. It is about some vague concept that is nothing and everything at the same time, but then why not treat each one of these cases as one would without the philosophical baggage?</p>

Except I can give you a thousand sentences that apply to *almost all* integers except one number. For instance "every integer is either smaller or larger than 1", which applies to all numbers except 1. You can say the sets of positive and negative integers are special in some ways, but that is still true for lots and lots of such sentences. And how are positive and negative numbers defined, after all? Usually by being smaller or larger than 0.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I'm going to argue against myself here for a moment and say that probably a paraconsistent logic could be derived that gives a "true" truth value to exactly those kinds of sentences, which could, in classical logic, be interpreted as saying "true for almost all" or something. My issue isn't that such a logic might not exist or even be useful but that "contradiction" is taken to mean everything and nothing which renders it meaningless as an explanation. Why do stones keep falling? Contradiction. Why does the universe exist? Contradiction. What would a universe be like if contradiction didn't simultaneously exist and not exist? That's a contradiction because you can't make that assumption without contradiction. If contradiction is simultaneously everything and nothing at all, if everything is implied by contradiction and also nothing is, then we might as well leave it away as a hypothesis because it has no consequences whatsoever!</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> This is why formalization is so important, particularly when dealing with exotic concepts: unless you make it completely clear what you're talking about you can use big words and apparently sound reasoning to arrive at any conclusion whatsoever! It's only when you say that "this is what I mean, this is my hypothesis, these are the consequences, this is what cannot follow, *this is the system*" that you can really say something *reasonable*!</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Alright, here I'll try to argue against myself, both to steelman the case, to show the hidden assumptions and because my position is actually not that far removed from it: if you assume that *logical* contradiction φ ∧ ¬ φ *semantically* means "both the state φ is taken and some other state that is unstable with φ in that it cannot be held by anything more than a small amount", then you can see this pattern as one or maybe even the driving motor of development in the physical universe. Furthermore, maybe the prototypical example of this state of affairs is that between positive and negative numbers (though that is very arguable). Since contradiction is the driving motor of our physical universe, we can assume it is also that of mathematics (I'd certainly argue *that*), so we can assume that the thing that embodies this contradiction the most, zero, is the "first" mathematical object to exist (again, a pretty big jump). This is borne out precisely because zero is the initial object of *Set* and other "spatial" categories, meaning the object at the start. Furthermore, zero "is" in this sense in every other object in that a morphism ∅ → X exists for every object in every one such category.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> My issues are several:

1. as noted, there are some pretty big jumps in there.

2. Even to assume that zero exists in, say, a model of ZFC is to assume that *a model of ZFC* exists, so you're assuming *something before nothing*. You can assume that *nothing* exists in that you use the empty set, or "emptiness" to not assume sets exist, as a model,  but in that model nothing is generated.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> The steelmanning is basically correct (though incomplete :D). I don't think the jumps are impossible but the point of 2. is that the model of ZFC has come into being through basically the process of excluding contradictions from mathematics over historical time, which would be annoying (as in, please write several dissertations) to show here so I won't. 

It's because we're dealing with the ground of things (that’s why it has this ‘I’m pulling my hair out, it seems to apply to everything, property: because it does apply to everything) --- this isn't just my point but as far as I can tell it's Hegel's as well: that this whole, 'you have to loop back from the model to the ground and from the ground to the model' --- i.e. zero is the grounding mathematical object, but it is only discovered *after* you fully exhaust a previous grounding object (which would have been ‘1’ for like the Sumerians or Babylonians and even the Greeks I think). 

The predictive power of contradiction is this: that whenever you think you have a good consistent complete mathematical (metaphysical) system where you know how everything works and how everything relates to everything else --- you don't. I.e. that the universe is always going to have to be in motion in order to avoid a contradiction, the most primary of which is the contradiction of nothing which forces (some)things into being (incompleteness is a kind of acceptance of this contradiction by placing a *consistent wrapper* of 'incompleteness' around the system rather than saying 'my system is perfect' which would be impossible). Its predictive power (after the fact, i.e. just like how zero is found after all the numbers or at least after all the positives) is that you don't have to run around wondering why there is something rather than nothing. There is something *because* Nothing is contradiction itself --- you could never be in a universe where nothing existed because then reality would be inconsistent.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> This appears in the point where you say that 'the real meeting point is that they all exist' --- yes, exactly, the real meeting point is that they are all *not nothing* --- i.e. that they are all attempts to avoid the contradiction, all constantly moving to avoid that contradiction (or as we get into chapter 1, all becoming). 

It's the constant demand that things be put in motion. (Also, if you read the axiom of the power-set --- it doesn't say that you *may* create these power-sets, it says that if S exists then the power set of S exists, period...)

But besides this, the more fundamental point is that negation is a more powerful and fundamental relation than equality. After all, equality is merely a special case of double negation (where the double negation returns you to where you started rather than jumping you into something random in that c = not not a when ‘not a’ doesn’t include the whole universe, as in a car is not an apple and a cat is not a car so not not an apple is a cat). This is the kind of ‘formalization' of possibility that Badoiu and Zizek are working with. The reason the kids like them is because they are not foreclosing possibility at the fundamental philosophical level because they accept negation as the fundamental object of their dialectics (which is the metaphysics of pure negation or we should say the metaphysics of contradiction) rather than trying to move only through equality (which admittedly is nice to do if you are, for example, in the academy, because if anyone comes up to you and says ‘hey this move is wrong’ you can point at the *equality* of the move and say ‘no I just followed the rules ma’am’ --- but that isn’t how a revolutionary movement will move --- a revolutionary movement will always have this moment of pure negation where there isn’t equality but only ‘not the current state of things’ and the particular negation has to be speculatively chosen by the people in that moment, with the move chosen becoming the new ground).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think this might help --- what is meant by 'contradiction, the contradiction, etc' in Hegel, as far as I can tell, is proof by contradiction with two addendums:

1. All constructive proofs are ultimately proofs by contradiction at their base (i.e. in reality these axioms are actually metaphysical objects ultimately derived through proof by contradiction from contradiction itself, they aren't really 'assumed' but instead 'developed' out of contradiction and the reason why people say 'assume x' is because they either don't want to go through their reasoning from contradiction because it would be tedious or else they are using intuitive calculation --- calculation based on all their previous observations --- to get to the point but they don't know *why* they think this true, just that they do). 

2. Contradictions themselves can also be treated as objects (i.e. you can just call them 'C' or 'C1' and treat them like any other element) and subjected to the self-same proof by contradiction as other objects.</p>

"

Yeah, but we're talking about ontology, not history. If you go by historical progress, then, again, 1 was used before 0. Furthermore, ZFC enjoys no particularly excellent status. It was a hastily thrown-together model to avoid Russell's paradox. Its metaphysics are unclear, as I underlined several times, and within mathematics it is only used as a kind of standard that one might follow or not. It's really not in any way firm ground to stand on. Regardless, the point stands: if you assume that nothing exists within a context, any context, you assume the context exists, thus you assume something exists. If you take nothing as a context, it is not generative, it simply remains nothing.

"It's because we're dealing with the ground of things (that’s why it has this ‘I’m pulling my hair out, it seems to apply to everything, property: because it does apply to everything)" 

I get that, but it still has to say, well, something, or it's meaningless. 

"this isn't just my point but as far as I can tell it's Hegel's as well: "

Well, no, because Hegel assumes that "the ground"/"the beginning" is *being*. 

"zero is the grounding mathematical object, but it is only discovered after you fully exhaust a previous grounding object (which would have been ‘1’ for like the Sumerians or Babylonians and even the Greeks I think). "

Then really you couldn't say whether it was actually "the ground" or only the next in a ladder of objects discovered as mathematics gets explored.

"The predictive power of contradiction is this: that whenever you think you have a good consistent complete mathematical (metaphysical) system where you know how everything works and how everything relates to everything else "

It's easy to prove that impossible…</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> without any metaphysical assumptions other than that we can do mathematics in some way. However, that's not a contradiction, not even in the extended logical sense I outlined yesterday. Mathematics is literally infinite, there are always propositions that aren't proven. The Greeks probably knew that! 

"that the universe is always going to have to be in motion in order to avoid a contradiction, the most primary of which is the contradiction of nothing which forces (some)things into being "

Except, again, that it is perfectly possible to use "nothing"/the empty set as a model, without it contradicting itself in any way. You still haven't dealt with that! In fact, that would even be a complete system!

"(incompleteness is a kind of acceptance of this contradiction by placing a consistent wrapper of 'incompleteness' around the system rather than saying 'my system is perfect' which would be impossible)"

Again, no it is not. As I just wrote, the empty model would be complete. Incompleteness only comes into play *once* you have the natural numbers. Simple systems like the empty system are complete. The incompleteness theorems have become fetishized by people who don't understand them and are trodded out to provide superficial justifications for metaphysical concepts that have nothing to do with them. They are statements about the inability of finite beings to reason about infinite systems, to (perhaps overly) simplify, not about contradiction.

"There is something because Nothing is contradiction itself --- you could never be in a universe where nothing existed because then reality would be inconsistent."

Again, no. You can have a model using the nothing. You can only generate things out of nothing if that "nothing" is treated as an object in a larger context, which assumes the context.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "that they are all attempts to avoid the contradiction, all constantly moving to avoid that contradiction (or as we get into chapter 1, all becoming). "

Except that you don't have a contradiction.

"Also, if you read the axiom of the power-set --- it doesn't say that you may create these power-sets, it says that if S exists then the power set of S exists, period"

Well, yes, though I don't get the point. Mathematicians talk all the time as if they simultaneously created and discovered the objects they investigate.

"But besides this, the more fundamental point is that negation is a more powerful and fundamental relation than equality"

Well that's certainly not true! You can have a logic without negation just fine, a logic without equality however wouldn't work at all! 

"After all, equality is merely a special case of double negation"

Again, absolutely not. Double negation is only even equivalent to truth of the original proposition if you assume the law of the excluded middle (LEM). If you don't, and there are good reasons not to, you couldn't even identify it with *logical equivalence*, nevermind equality!

"(where the double negation returns you to where you started rather than jumping you into something random in that c = not not a when ‘not a’ doesn’t include the whole universe, as in a car is not an apple and a cat is not a car so not not an apple is a cat)."

That's more usually just called faulty reasoning.

"The reason the kids like them is because they are not foreclosing possibility at the fundamental philosophical level because they accept negation as the fundamental object of their dialectics"

I think more the reason kids like them is because Zizek is funny and most of his stuff doesn't require much theoretical setup, nevermind rigor…</p>

Yeah, sure, those evil academics using their equality, why can't they accept the fundamental truth of double negation? We're talking about ontology here, not revolution. I know Badiou wants to prove that revolution is ontologically required, but that would have to be proven and can thus not be used as an argument. You're really just throwing stuff together here while trying to claim the revolutionary mantle. But if you fancy yourself a revolutionary that would be all the more reason to have your fundamentals correct. Finally, the reason mathematicians do the stuff they do is not because they're dusty academics who just repeat dogma but because they *don't* and *can't* dictate the rules of their ontology to the object of their study.</p>

As far as I can tell what you are really saying is that people start with some assumptions, find the flaw in those assumptions, then change their setup and continue. Yes, but that's not a proof by contradiction except in that you found a contradiction in your previous system, so you move on to another one.

"…from contradiction itself"

You just take that as an article of faith.

"Contradictions themselves can also be treated as objects (i.e. you can just call them 'C' or 'C1' and treat them like any other element) and subjected to the self-same proof by contradiction as other objects."

In what setup? I'd even be inclined to grant you that that is possible because you can do similar things with equalities, proofs or formulas, but you need to define the setup in which you do it! And also, to define that you need lots of other mathematical objects so you can't use it as a base of your ontology.</p>

...

Is that it is inherent in the definition of 'set' that you have powersets and thus you already have the reality explosion even if you just try to reach for only the empty set. Also, the metaphysics of ZFC is precisely the hegelian metaphysics --- an ungodly hack placed over a contradiction (which you can quibble here and there over other things but Russell's paradox is a traditional god's honest contradiction, and in fact, now that I think about it, it is *the* contradiction of early 20th century mathematics).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> However, if we consider what you want 'nothing without any other context' --- my point is that the only thing which is always nothing, without any other context, is a contradiction (i.e. the thing which always can't exist, the thing which always fails to exist --- a failure which persists in paraconsistency by simply making contradictions into not contradictions through various limitations on contradiction that make it literally para*consistent* and thus allow it to pop back into existence as something less than a contradiction, less than nothing). I challenge you to show me a nothing that is both intelligible as nothing --- that definitely is nothing and definitely doesn’t exist --- and also something other than a contradiction. I don’t think Hegel would agree that it's something else...

In chapter 1, when Hegel says that nothing is not any particular determination (not any of the A or not A that could exist) He’s saying its ‘not (A or not A’) i.e. ‘not A and not not A’... and since we’re dealing with totality here and the LEM holds because everything falls into either ‘A or not A’ for some determinations A (and here ‘A’ is just a stand in for all possible determinations) that means that ‘not A and not not A’ = ‘not A and A’, or... a contradiction. The difference between being and nothing, as I read it is that being is tautologically opposed, so its ‘A or not A’ without the negation which amounts to something equally trivial (a different kind of explosion), which means that becoming becomes C1 (nothing) and not C1 (being)... making becoming into a repetition of the original nothing (this point hegel is not clear on but I think that’s for ideological reasons having to do with God and other nonsense... he desperately wants to start with being rather than nothing, which is the more materialist place to start, I believe, because it emphasizes negation and difference as primary rather than tautology which is, I think, the difference between idealism and materialism).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> This is the surplus in nothing which allows us to actually get off the ground, the thing nothing must be for there to be something (the I am therefore nothing is a contradiction and not just some nebulous other thing without any form or function). And yes this is a speculative position, (which might be called a kind of faith, though speculation is what faith is when it's done by scientists and mathematicians --- i.e. a theory that must withstand attack) but its the kind of speculative position which I feel for me at least has withstood the constant collision with reality --- once again, give me a nothing without any other context that isn’t contradiction --- I don't think you can and I don't think you have other than simply asserting that you have (and as I pointed out, if you just say its ‘not everything else’... you’re dealing with a contradiction because 'neither' is a contradiction in any context where nothing is the only context --- i.e. if your context is 'no context but nothing' then your context is not context_1 and not context_2 and... and not context_n for all possible n, and since all possible n are opposed to each other (i.e. for every context Cx there is a not Cx) you're creating a contradiction simply by stating you don't want a context at all, though as the meme says 'change my mind').</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Finally, there are a bunch of other things which I think are miscommunications that I object to but I don't have time to address them all --- I will note as an example that when I say negation is more fundamental than equality your response is that I'm dumb because I don't know about LEM is strange when my whole point with the chain of reasoning --- not not apple = cat, is what happens when you drop LEM and how equality goes to shit while negation keeps plugging on happily. The disagreement is that I view the chain of reasoning thus produced as a feature and a bug rather than merely a bug: it tells us more about how the universe functions than the chain of mere equalities because it tells us that our whole framework for thinking can be wrong, that our equalities are always based on speculative divisions that exclude some object in order to function, though if you want a better version --- not an apple is fertilizer and not fertilizer is an orange and thus not not an apple is an orange --- which is the (oversimplified but basically correct) logic of things when over long time an orchard replaces its apple trees with orange trees that are fertilized with the remains of the old apples.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@dve.h_37844#0</span> The potential in contradiction is negation --- contradiction requires negation to function, i.e. 'false' is a required outcome of contradiction (which is, in my understanding, what becoming amounts to --- mere falseness). The reason 'false' is important is because the distinction between contradiction and 'false' is that 'false' *could* be true, is *possible* but 'merely' false and thus opens the path to things being true.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> But as for the working class: 

Well the way I read it, the point is that we need to stop saying that capitalism is contradictory and thus will end itself in crises. Everything contains these contradictory movements, whatever comes after will also have a contradictory movement. Rather, its about the stability or ‘development out of’ contradiction which is important. Capitalism requires constant development out of its own contradiction rather than having some kind of stabilized loop. For me, this is driven by the fact that the contradiction lies in the realm of political-economy, the economic contradiction constantly destabilizes the political one which then constantly attempts to recuperate the economic contradiction (in various failed ways). Under socialism, I believe that the political contradiction must remain (so the things which are meant to deal with political contradiction, things like freedom of speech, religion, association, etc. must be maintained and bolstered) --- however I think this can only be done by recognizing contradiction in the realm of theory (i.e. recognizing that we will have to force workers to be the master, and we will have to wrap their mastery in a system that is opaque enough,indirect enough, and arbitrary enough that we don’t get the explosion of rule by experts that is endemic to Stalinism, this is the theoretical contradiction).</p>

By this I mean that in every situation there is a forcing function (even a dance is defined by the force of consent of the parties dancing, excluding other possibilities like fighting): here the point is that the only mastery left to the volunteeristic left is the mastery of getting the non-volunteeristic working class to rule themselves. Because the system we are dealing with is so large this will involve an appeal to reason every where (least force), politics in most places (next least), economics in many places (next least after that) but also civil war in some places (i.e. the idea that global socialist revolution won't involve some actual force is also a mistake). Its just that I don't think it will involve as much force as people who look at 1917 tend to think.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> I think that ultimately the problem has to do with totality: totality, I think, is the LEM, once you have totality you have some determination where everything can be broken into either A or not A, that's what it means to have a totality (you've accounted for totally everything in some determination, everything either is one thing or it isn't --- in this case everything either is in your model of nothing or it isn't in your model of nothing). And so when you ask for a model of pure nothing --- with not context, I read that as asking for a totality, which means that you have to have the LEM in your pure nothing which means there has to, implicitly, be some kind of determination that splits the the pure nothing (total nothing) into A vs. not A but then if the nothing comes down on either side of that, then it doesn't consume the whole space (i.e. it acquires the property of being either A or not A, it acquires the property of being self-equal as one or the other) and if its tautological (A or not A), then whatever it is it definitely exists which doesn't seem like a nothing to me (nothing shouldn't exist). Thus the only thing it could be, while being total and being nothing, is both A and not A (which is fine because, A and not A actually is a nothing in that it doesn't ever exist) and the nothing loses even the property of being self-equal and remains only total (which was what you demanded in the first place) even while being not total (because, of course, now that its a contradiction, it starts to generate other objects).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "Also, the metaphysics of ZFC is precisely the hegelian metaphysics"

Well, if so, time-traveling Hegel would have been wrong, so I'm really hoping he has more to offer than ZFC. Also, ZFC is traditionally generated from the empty set, as you noted, Hegel starts with *being*. I feel like you're all too quick to opportunistically claim Hegel.



"Russell's paradox is a traditional god's honest contradiction, and in fact, now that I think about it, it is the contradiction of early 20th century mathematics)."

It's only a contradiction if you want your model to have a presence within itself, and even then only if you assume it obeys the rules of a set. If you consider it as a class, such as in Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, you don't arrive at a contradiction. But really, what you should take it as saying is that each mathematical structure large enough to house most of mathematics generates and is nested in even larger structures, like Russian nesting dolls. You never arrive at a fixed point. That would be a defendable version of your point.

"So you can't have the empty set sans a context."

Not as a *set* but you can consider *nothing* without a context.

"However, if we consider what you want 'nothing without any other context' --- my point is that the only thing which is always nothing, without any other context, is a contradiction"

And my point is that it is not contradictory (which usually people take as the hallmark of a contradiction).

"I challenge you to show me a nothing that is both intelligible as nothing --- that definitely is nothing and definitely doesn’t exist"

Why would I assume it doesn't exist? Zoom in on spacetime until you only have point. Then remove the point. Voila, you have nothing. 

"when Hegel says that nothing is not any particular determination (not any of the A or not A that could exist) He’s saying its ‘not (A or not A’) i.e. ‘not A and not not A’."</p>

First, what Hegel is saying exactly is "Nichts, das reine Nichts; es ist einfache Gleichheit mit sich selbst, vollkommene Leerheit, Bestimmungs- und Inhaltslosigkeit; Ununterschiedenheit in ihm selbst"

So Hegel says *not* that nothing is without determination but that nothing is *complete lack of determination*. However, when you're saying when you're saying "its (A or not A’)", you're saying *nothing is without determination*. However, then the entire section of SoL wouldn't make sense, since it is precisely determining what nothing *is* through giving some determinations. Nothing itself isn't *undetermined* it is *undeterminedness*. It itself determined precisely by this section and this sentence in particular. That's not contradictory.

Also, only a side note, but note that Hegel writes 

"so ist (existiert) Nichts in unserem Anschauen oder Denken; oder vielmehr ist es das leere Anschauen und Denken selbst"
"so nothing *exists* in our … thinking…"

So Hegel certainly thinks you can think nothing.

"this point hegel is not clear on but I think that’s for ideological reasons having to do with God and other nonsense... he desperately wants to start with being rather than nothing"

No, you desparately want to start from nothing even though it doesn't make sense.

"which is the more materialist place to start"

Materialism is assuming everything is matter. Believing everything springs from nothing would be more like nihilism. In any case, I don't see what it has to do with any even remotely practical or even philosophically defensible notion of materialism.

"because it emphasizes negation and difference as primary rather than tautology which is, I think, the difference between idealism and materialism"

It is if you completely redefine the terms for your point.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> " a theory that must withstand attack"

Correct, you have to defend your model, I only have to point out its incoherence. So even if I *couldn't* (and I can) give you a model of "nothing without context", it suffices to point out that if you're assuming that nothing exists in a context, you're assuming the context exists, and thus assuming something exists.

"if your context is 'no context but nothing' then your context is not context_1 and not context_2 and... and not context_n for all possible n, and since all possible n are opposed to each other (i.e. for every context Cx there is a not Cx) you're creating a contradiction simply by stating you don't want a context at all, though as the meme says 'change my mind')."

No, because "nothing" doesn't have to be defined as a negation, it can simply be defined as the simplest possible model of the empty theory (which is both a positive determination and a universal property).

"your response is that I'm dumb"

I'm not saying you're dumb, I'm saying you're sloppy and use reasoning that doesn't acknowledge all its premises to arrive at conclusions you want to reach. You're doing what I said before: you're letting your ontological assumptions dictate to the object of your study. Also, you strawman your counterpositions. Your "better version" is exactly an example of that:

"not an apple is fertilizer
 not fertilizer is an orange
 thus not not an apple is an orange"

Aristotle has already explained the failures of such flawed syllogisms. But in modern language, and going through it in some detail:
saying "x is not an apple" means, "x does not have the property of being an apple", it doesn't mean "x is defined by or the only thing that is not an apple. In modern, set-theoretic language, (which you should know since you like ZFC so much) "fertilizer is in the set of things that are not fertilizer". Similarly then "oranges are in the set of things that are not apples". Thus, you cannot draw the interference</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "not not an apple is an orange" since the set of things that are not fertilizer might contain more than one element. The key is that the word "is" can be used to describe both equality and subset inclusion, which allows for such constructions that people could and have quickly found the flaw in but that superficially look like syllogisms. This is precisely why I disdain when people use wordplay to make their points. In any case, LEM or the failure of LEM doesn't say that this construction would be possible but the failure of LEM claims that things could exist for which it is neither true that they are either apples or (completely) not apples, such as perhaps hybrids of apples with some other fruit or very exotic apples that are almost another fruit. 

"which is the (oversimplified but basically correct) logic of things when over long time an orchard replaces its apple trees with orange trees that are fertilized with the remains of the old apples."

Logic is precisely defined by the fact that it doesn't depend on special cases but that its conclusions are valid whenever it is semantically applicable.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Also, you're using unnecessarily complicated vocabulary to make your arguments unapproachable. The successive discussion is an example of that. What the hell is a "forcing function" and why would anyone ever use that term instead of just saying "there is some force involved in everything" except to appear more sophisticated than they are? And you're connecting questions of political relevance to those of logic *without getting the logic right*. That's what worries me. Marxism came into being by applying Hegelian logic to current politics, but Marx never was that sloppy and wherever he was sloppy it became a huge problem for successive generations. It is not just a question of aesthetics to keep your political arguments as simple as possible but one of ethics. So when I see someone using mathematical vocabulary almost nobody knows to make political points there better be a good reason for it and they better get the mathematics right, otherwise it is confusing sophistry.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> Ok, in more detail:

"totality, I think, is the LEM"

That's an unwarrented identification.

"you've accounted for totally everything in some determination"

Not LEM doesn't say that every thing doesn't have some unique property

"And so when you ask for a model of pure nothing --- with not context, I read that as asking for a totality, which means that you have to have the LEM"

That falls away if you don't make the above identification, but you can assume lem and still have nothing as a model.

"which means there has to, implicitly, be some kind of determination that splits the the pure nothing (total nothing) into A vs. not A"

Lem says "for every x and property φ either x fulfills φ or it fulfills ¬φ". In the empty model, no x exists, so no property φ can split it into parts.

"then it doesn't consume the whole space"

There is no space in the empty model.

The rest falls apart because, again, there is no split.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> No, there is a split because there is a totality. There's a split because there is a you to do the splitting, the empty theory stands in contradistinction to you. When you demand 'the simplest possible model of the empty theory ' you are already performing the split in that starting determination and then wrapping the contradiction that the starting determination creates in an assumption to protect the determination from the contradiction it entails (i.e. you've moved the negation into 'empty theory' --- i.e. theory which *doesn't* (negation) have axioms --- in order to make nothing into not a negation) and you want to pretend you aren't doing that which is the metaphysical move of totality (or, in politics, totalitarianism) par excellence --- i.e. setting the terms of the debate and removing its assumptions from consideration before the debate even occurs. And I'm telling you can have your totality, but only if its a contradiction, you don't get a happy smooth harmonious totality.

I'm saying nothing is undeterminedness (lack of difference in some other object) which is also undetermined (lack of difference in this object). Its both. The reason being that there is no firm determination between 'thing' and 'property' --- so to say a thing lacks a property is also to say that there is a lack of a thing, there is a thing that doesn't exist (or to put it another way, to say a thing doesn't exist is to say that totality lacks the *property* of the thing that doesn't exist). Or to put it even another way, undetermitedness is a determination without a determination, a difference without a difference (because it applies to everything, everything lacks a determination w.r.t. to itself at least).</p>

When I say that I have a vector in 3 space and then ask about its properties in 4 space, those properties have to hold no matter what the value of the fourth dimension happens to be: if the 3 space happens to be at t = 0 or t = 1000 (using t because there isn't a number after z, don't assume time). The lack of determination in the 3 space, its failure to pin down a difference in the fourth dimension, *is also* a statement that what we're saying about this 3 space applies to all 4 spaces in which it could be embedded. That lack of determination on where we are in 4 space simply says 'we are everywhere in 4 space'. If I put a sphere at 0, 0, 0 in 3 space then it is at all possible values of t in 4 space until I specify (determine) where it actually is in 4 space. i.e. I have a sphere with a center at multiple distinct location, i.e. a contradiction.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "No, there is a split because there is a totality"

If by totality you mean a closed model, then no, because it's empty. 

"There's a split because there is a you to do the splitting,"

That's not at all the point you've made before. But as a point it doesn't make sense: I exist, therefore something exists, therefore not just nothing exists, therefore the empty model can't *describe reality*, therefore "nothing" doesn't exist, therefore there is a contradiction is not a valid chain of reasoning because it again precludes its result, because there wouldn't be a contradiction *if you didn't assume "nothing" existed*. Furthermore, a model not being real doesn't mean it isn't *consistent* in itself. This one certainly is. 

"you've moved the negation into 'empty theory' --- i.e. theory which doesn't (negation) have axioms --- in order to make nothing into not a negation"

No, the empty theory is actually the most natural one. But I can also give you a thousand theories that are *not* empty and whose initial model is empty. Say, the theory given by one axiom:

∀x: x = x
Forall x holds, x equals x

Since there are no existence assumptions in that theory, it applies to the empty structure, even though it has axioms.

"…or, in politics, totalitarianism…"

Real classy.

"setting the terms of the debate and removing its assumptions from consideration before the debate even occurs."

Sorry, I didn't set up how logic works.

Also, again, I don't need to show that an empty model exists for your position to be inconsistent. Even if it wouldn't my objection that you're already assuming something by assuming the context around your nothing along which its rules, which is what you use to actually generate things out of that, is *something*.

"I'm saying nothing is undeterminedness (lack of difference in some other object) which is also undetermined (lack of difference in this object)"

No, you just determined it…</p>

That is actually not completely untrue but the property of being indeterminateness can itself be determined.

"Or to put it even another way, undetermitedness is a determination without a determination, a difference without a difference (because it applies to everything, everything lacks a determination w.r.t. to itself at least)."

Everything you say determines indeterminateness even more.

"When I say that I have a vector in 3 space and then ask about its properties in 4 space, those properties have to hold no matter what the value of the fourth dimension happens to be: if the 3 space happens to be at t = 0 or t = 1000 (using t because there isn't a number after z, don't assume time). The lack of determination in the 3 space, its failure to pin down a difference in the fourth dimension, is also a statement that what we're saying about this 3 space applies to all 4 spaces in which it could be embedded."

Well, yes, that is again kind-of true and we have ways to talk about that.

"That lack of determination on where we are in 4 space simply says 'we are everywhere in 4 space'."

No, it says "we are nowhere in particular in any 4-dimensional space". It *doesn't* say "we are everywhere at once". That would be literally considering the family of all embeddings of that 3-space into any 4-space at the same time. You can actually give some meaning to your statement but if approached naively it isn't what you claim. Note also that I'm not saying "4 space" because there isn't just one.

" If I put a sphere at 0, 0, 0 in 3 space then it is at all possible values of t in 4 space until I specify (determine) where it actually is in 4 space. i.e. I have a sphere with a center at multiple distinct location, i.e. a contradiction."

No it's not. What it is though is a category, with a sphere S, spaces T and morphisms S → T.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> No, I think we should tarry with this one a bit --- you don't get category theory. What you get is an object in 3 space which is undetermined in 4 space. Both of which are stupid boring euclidian spaces without any twisting or topological nonsense going on. That's the nothing that you wanted correct, you want a lack of determination of some kind? 

My point is you don't get to take my perfectly fine 3 space sphere and apply a function or morph-ism to it to force consistency and split it into a set or even worse a category of multiple spheres in multiple spaces or any of that. That's all for the future when we're desperately trying to make the contradiction go away again, because we need a way to consistently relate boring stupid euclidean 4 space and euclidean 3 space (at which point our sphere won't be undetermined, because its 4th dimension will be 't for some t' or something like that --- which is a determination). Right now we are in a world where all that beautiful *development* hasn't occurred and the response to make it consistent  *could* be any of the ones you've given (i.e. we do a morphism, or we say actually objects in 3 space are never in 4 space or etc. etc.) or it could even be, objects in 3 space always enter 4 space at t = 0 by convention. But we haven't done these things yet. We are before these choices. Right now, the 3 space object is at location <0, 0, 0, ∄>, correct?

And my point is that the way to make sense of this ∄ is as a contradiction first, then later we fix it, and part of that is that we don't have to fix it through the generalization (the morphism from space to another), we could fix it by convention to 0. Or we could say that its a 3-sphere moving through a limited set of points in 4 space. Or whatever. But before any of those choices are made, this ∄ is any and all of those mutually exclusive paths forward, its all the points in 4 space and all the ways of escaping the very question of it being all the points in 4 space.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> "What you get is an object in 3 space which is undetermined in 4 space."

That's not a thing. What is a thing is a category wherein this makes sense.

"Both of which are stupid boring euclidian spaces without any twisting or topological nonsense going on … you want a lack of determination of some kind?"

That's a huge determination.

"That's the nothing that you wanted correct"

No, the nothing I'm saying is a consistent complete model contains *no* points and has *no* dimension (not even 0 but you could also say it has dimension -∞).

"My point is you don't get to take my perfectly fine 3 space sphere"

You don't get to embed your sphere into every point of "4-space" just to call it "inconsistent". Why would I assume there exists a 4-space at all? Or that the default case would be somehow that a 3-dimensional object would be in 4-dimensional space, or actually anywhere else than in itself? What would that even mean without a category to make it meaningful? See, the lazy way is to scream "contradiction" each time there is something which has to be explained. The much harder way is to sit down, learn the theory, understand what the thing you're saying actually means and why it's probably not a contradiction (certainly this example isn't) and actually *think*. But who wants to do that? Particularly when you have all the answers already? Great developmental program, btw, you can really see how this contradictory philosophy spurs one to excellence!

"Right now, the 3 space object is at location <0, 0, 0, ∄>, correct?"

No, because I'm not automatically assuming objects are nested in each other, nevermind in undetermined locations. That's a way unwarranted assumption.

"And my point is that the way to make sense of this ∄ is as a contradiction first"

It's only a contradiction if you first make unwarrented assumptions to make it a contradiction. Again letting your ontological assumptions dictate to the object of your study.</p>

Neither am I, that's not careful or correct reading of what I'm saying (which is the case for a lot of the responses at this point)... Perhaps it would be helpful if I wrote it like this <0, 0, 0>, ∄. 

"It's only a contradiction if you first make unwarranted assumptions to make it a contradiction. Again letting your ontological assumptions dictate to the object of your study." --- no, its the reverse, its only *not* a contradiction if you make unwarranted assumptions to make it *not* a contradiction. Before √2 can be recognized as a real it must first be recognized as a contradiction under the rationals. 

What is the ontological consequence of the fact that the empty theory entails self contradictory theories as models which satisfy it?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> (because looking at category theory, I'm happy to buy the empty theory as nothing --- to me it seems to be indifference itself or as Hegel calls it 'nothing', Its indifferent to all models, but the consequence is that this means that its indifferent also to the contradictory models, in some sense it entails the contradictory models, and the only thing that entails a contradiction is a contradiction...). The empty model however, to me, looks more like being. Its not indifferent, in fact its the strictest model in some sense (maybe its the strictest period? Not certain), it only likes degenerate theories (like ∀x: x = x). Thus I would actually say that ∅:∅ is becoming, not nothing (because the very idea, really notion, of this relationship between model and theory is foundational for category theory itself, as I understand it, and that notion is the becoming called category theory).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "Neither am I, that's not careful or correct reading of what I'm saying"

Well, then there's no contradiction! The contradiction you wrote was

"If I put a sphere at 0, 0, 0 in 3 space then it is at all possible values of t in 4 space until I specify (determine) where it actually is in 4 space. i.e. I have a sphere with a center at multiple distinct location, i.e. a contradiction"

If the sphere isn't automatically assumed to be in 4-space, then it also isn't "at all possible values in 4-space". Problem solved! One could, however, write a much clearer and more meaningful sentence: "A sphere can be embedded into ℝ⁴ with any possible value as its center!" Glad we got that cleared up! Though, and admittedly that's a minor nitpick, but when you claim that the sphere "is" at location " <0, 0, 0, ∄>" or "<0, 0, 0>, ∄" you're not just implicitly assuming an embedding of the sphere with the word "is" but also an embedding of 3-dimensional space into 4-dimensional space, otherwise you couldn't identify the axes of ℝ³ with those of ℝ⁴. If you don't assume that embedding, you can map the sphere at any point into ℝ⁴. Also, again with the poetic descriptions! "<0, 0, 0>, ∄" or  <0, 0, 0, ∄> can be nicely interpreted if taken with some poetic flair, but literally it is meaningless. It is again a play to make a point, just with signs, not words. 

See, things like these are diabolical not because they are dumb but because they are clever. They are mere suggestions, leaving it to the mind of the reader to ascertain a meaning, like a frame in one of Doug's critical cuts, appropriate for art perhaps, but science… in science, clarity *is* the art! Presentation should be a mere window through which its object can be glimpsed, at its best when it is completely transparent, *never* should it leave its meaning to the reader or allow for multiple interpretations…</p>

What is a contradictory model? A logical theory can exhibit contradiction, but what would it mean for a model?

"Its not indifferent, in fact its the strictest model in some sense (maybe its the strictest period? Not certain), it only likes degenerate theories (like ∀x: x = x)."

Ah, it's a mathematical object, I don't think it "likes" anything. To be fair, mathematicians anthropomorphize mathematical objects too, but, again, reasoning from the likings of a thing is not exactly safe logical ground. 

More importantly however, the emptiness is actually  a model for more than half of all axioms, namely those that start with a forall-quantifier and the empty axiom. Who would have thought the only thing nothing wouldn't fulfill is "there exists something…"?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Actually, why don't you read a bit of Lawvere?

https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2450/0d0eea4696bf53f13a9a3080054645ab77b1.pdf

Most of his writings aren't particularly long and you already know a bit of category theory… sure there is some time investment but if you want to get to the truth of existence that has to be expected, and it's probably not harder than making sense of a Zizek-book, and much more stringent and… well, actual math and mathematical physics, iron-clad in its formalism, and learning it might steel your spirit. 

And at some point you might move on and read the nlab-entry of Science of Logic 

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Science+of+Logic

to see what Schreiber did with it… and even if perhaps you don't agree with some of it as a formalization of Hegel, there is no denying its truth as mathematical theory. And it comes along with lots of useful techniques that can be applied to a variety of considerations. Plus, it comes with its own lexicon, the nlab itself, which contains most category-theoretic vocabulary. And if at some point you manage to understand it even just a bit, you'll have understood a lot because the constructions bring you fairly close to current-day physics (keep in mind that Schreiber is a string-theorist first, mathematician second and philosopher only on the side).</p>

No what wasn't a careful reading (nor is your next reading careful either). The failure was you saying that I was assuming that items are nested in my second statement. I did assume that in the first (because I was trying to achieve simplicity and clarity but you threw that out by saying 'what about all the possible ways of fixing things' --- so by the second statement I am talking about not just the simple contradiction but the contradiction of 'all the ways to fix things, taken simultaneously, including both nesting of spaces and a lack of nesting of spaces, and setting things to zero and not setting things to zero, etc.) What I'm saying that any move I (or rather, probably you) make here is a *choice* --- whether we put it in 4 space or don't, or put it at zero, or put in 5 space. But, most importantly, its a *choice* spurred on by a contradiction (the only reason we have to make a choice is because there is a contradiction, if we didn't have a contradiction we could move smoothly through tautology to the next point). That's what I'm saying.

"Flourishes like these speak of a mind that is too much in love with itself to prioritize clarity of presentation over displays of brilliance. Such a mind is dangerous, not least to itself. After all, what quelches the pain of merciless inquiry easier than a clever snippet?" 

I don't know anything about that, I'm too busy determining indeterminism with every word I speak...

"What is a contradictory model? A logical theory can exhibit contradiction, but what would it mean for a model?"

A contradictory model would be a category of axioms that when interpreted as a theory are self-contradictory but when interpreted as a model are just some stupid text. After all there is nothing that forbids treating theories as models.</p>

Almost makes one wonder if one is talking to a mathematician, logician, or computer scientist when one is talking to someone who like to anthropomorphize mathematical objects...

I think that this isn't quite it --- it would accept some axioms with there exists (as long as they are in an conditional that insures nothing ever has to actually exist)... but really I suspect its all tautological theories?

Well, how was I supposed to know you were switching contradictions between statements? It would be a lot harder for me to "not read you carefully" if you were writing clearer. Or start side-remarks with a quotation sign and end them with a bracket. 

"What I'm saying that any move I (or rather, probably you) make here is a choice… have to make a choice is because there is a contradiction"

Granted, though I don't have to make any move at all, since I can just assume the sphere in question exists happily in itself, with the potential to be embedded in other spaces. No contradiction in sight, or at least I don't see one.

" if we didn't have a contradiction we could move smoothly through tautology to the next point "

We can, as far as I'm concerned!

"I don't know anything about that, I'm too busy determining indeterminism with every word I speak..."

I'm not sure whether to take that as an insult, but if so it does have some truth to it. It's not like I don't know the temptation of the behavior I'm describing, that's why I'm attuned to it. Still, I'm not trying to be obtuse on purpose. I'd love to explain why the quality of being indeterminate is itself determined in an iron-clad mathematical context that strips away the ambiguities of everyday language and demonstrates its statement without any ambiguity. But I'm trying to strike a balance here between the things I know, the things that can be read without much theoretical setup, the things that can be written without a latex-environment and the time I have. 

"A contradictory model would be a category of axioms that when interpreted as a theory are self-contradictory but when interpreted as a model are just some stupid text. After all there is nothing that forbids treating theories as models."

Well, you mentioned before you were a computer scientist and I kept that in mind. In fact, I would not have written some things if not since I couldn't have assumed you had the vocabulary to understand them.

"But it is interesting to think of how ∅:∅ might generate the natural numbers --->∅:∅ -> ∅:(∅:∅) -> ∅:(∅:(∅:∅)) -> ∅:(∅:(∅:(∅:∅))), etc...."

Well, yes, there are two extremal possibilities, I think: one is that each successive number contains all the previous ones, as you wrote down, and one that each only contains its predecessor. But is there really much of a difference? To me it seems like both are just particular encodings of the successor function. I guess if you squint hard you can identify the first with a "cardinal" understanding saying "each set of cardinality x contains as many objects as there are numbers below x" and one "ordinal"  one saying "each order whose ordinality is x is a chain as long as the chain of element inclusions into x", and their equivalence exhibits the equivalence of finite ordinals to cardinals.

" think that this isn't quite it --- it would accept some axioms with there exists"

That's why I said they have to start with a ∀-quantifier (or have no quantifiers, meaning it is the empty axiom): a chain like ∀x:Ey… is perfectly acceptable while a chain like ∃x:∀y… assumes the existence of x and therefore can't be true if nothing exists.

"but really I suspect its all tautological theories?"

No, no, no, think of, say, the theory of all partial orders, or the theory of all semigroups or commutative semigroups… you just can't have distinguished elements, like neutral elements or top/bottom elements…</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> "I mean I can see why people don't read Lawvere --- when he was talking about '200 or so researchers in category theory' in his pamphlet he might as well have said 'and if you aren't one of them don't bother reading this'. Like we're reading hegel chapter by chapter, that pamphlet wants to be read paragraph by paragraph..."

I admit the amount of vocabulary is a problem. Note though that this is due to the nature of the material, Lawvere is actually trying to keep it as accessible as possible, as you can see by the clarity of his prose and the, heroic but maybe actually more confusing than clarifying, effort to avoid mathematical notation. I actually wrote an exposition of Schreiber's treatment of Hegel about 1.5 years ago that introduces all the vocabulary in itself:

https://gitlab.com/nameiwillforget/nheehegel-in-mathematicshe

I recently re-edited it and thought it held up fairly well, with the caveat that it is about Schreiber's interpretation (which builds on Lawvere's but isn't the same) and tries only to convey it without comment on how close it held to the original text. Also, Lawvere wrote an introductory book to category theory and adjecent areas called "Conceptual Mathematics", which can be downloaded here:

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> "We can, as far as I'm concerned!"

And I think that's really my basic point, is that we can move forward as far as you're concerned because you're operating with a foreclosure (a pinning point that covers up a contradiction) in the form of category theory created by the fact that you've already been given all these tools by history. If not for that (like if you were one of the first people to think this idea) you would have to painfully derive the idea of a category of spheres out of the contradiction (or say something like 'without loss of generality, set t = 0' and hope your audience accepts that statement), it wouldn't come immediately or naturally (which we know because even with division the Babylonians were running around without generalized division algorithms for thousands of years, because for them it was *division* which was the contradiction). 

"I don't know anything about that, I'm too busy determining indeterminism with every word I speak..."

I'm just laughing because the pot is calling the kettle black. Don't take it as an insult though, It's a compliment. The line made me laugh when I first read it. 

"However, note that those axioms you speak of are only contradictory when interpreted as a theory, as a model of some meta-theory the category of such axioms would be unremarkable…" 

I'm not convinced that this true... I'm convinced the first half is true, but the second part, there's something much more interesting going on there that I wouldn't call 'unremarkable': i.e. this notion of 'model' where we don't have to interpret the text (or where we might say we have a program but we aren't forced to run it). This is, I think, the generalized form of the wrapper around contradiction (like the thing which protects from a contradiction written on paper is the paper itself, the thing which protects it in our mind is that the place which thinks the words of the contradiction is separated from the place which 'does' the contradiction). So be careful...</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "Well, yes, there are two extremal possibilities, I think: one is that each successive number contains all the previous ones, as you wrote down, and one that each only contains its predecessor. But is there really much of a difference? To me it seems like both are just particular encodings of the successor function. I guess if you squint hard you can identify the first with a "cardinal" understanding saying "each set of cardinality x contains as many objects as there are numbers below x" and one "ordinal"  one saying "each order whose ordinality is x is a chain as long as the chain of element inclusions into x", and their equivalence exhibits the equivalence of finite ordinals to cardinals."

Actually I think at some point the arrow -> becomes usable and then that becomes the successor function (at which point you really are off to the races), but a more interesting question might be how do the negative numbers make their way into this: they could be packed in as every other number but I wonder if its possible to construct a theory like this  (((∅:∅):∅)):∅):∅ <- ((∅:∅):∅):∅) <- (∅:∅):∅) <- ∅:∅ (with zero as just :∅:, i.e. as a petit objet a that fluctuates between model and theory). What ever (∅:∅) means as a theory it would have to tautological to function? I'm not saying I know what this means (if anything) just playing with symbols but I have a suspicion...</p>

But aren't these theories all tautological (i.e. because they lack an distinguishing base object that must exist, they're all just describing tautological moves like a≤a,  if  a≤b and b≤a, then a=b). Here I *don't* want to fetishize the fact that for normal math these things are tautological, I understand there may be a theory where a≤a,  if  a≤b and b≤a, then a=b might be false somehow when combined with other appropriate axioms...

What I mean is that I'm speculating that ∃x is the non-tautological move par-excellence and all of these other things are just tautology without ∃x to tie them down to something less than tautology (or something more, since my big dialectical realization was that tautology and contradiction aren't the farthest concepts to each but rather the closest concepts to each other so that bottom and top are right next to each other: tautologies are always almost false --- one half the tautology is false and its only barely holding on through the other half --- and contradictions are always almost true --- same thing, one half is always true and its only barred by the other half). 

However, this reading maybe involves accepting or understanding that the model is an ∃x (i.e. the moment you propose a model, M, every object in the model could be entered into the theory as ∀O∈M∃O, without changing the satisfaction of the theory) which then makes the empty *model* equal to tautology because if I say ∄x, then I can say whatever nonsense I want about x and I'm protected (wrapper!) by the does not exist.</p>

I'm not denying that there is historical development, or that that development often comes from the attempt to answer an open question or systematize a heuristic, what I'm saying is that those aren't contradictions, logically speaking, and I don't really know what else a contradiction is. And every once in a while there is development based on a recognized inconsistency of the old system, but that's by no means all mathematical development.

"I'm convinced the first half is true, but the second part, there's something much more interesting going on there that I wouldn't call 'unremarkable"

Well, I also think such meta-theories aren't unremarkable. But notice that to prove that such theories are models of a meta-theory as I outlined, one does need to check them for consistency. Consider the meta-theory consisting of one sentence:

"For T [a model of the meta-theory] it holds that the there exists a sentence φ such that both φ and ¬φ can be derived from T."

This can only be checked by trying to derive sentences from T and looking if for any of them one can also prove its negation.

"… but a more interesting question might be how do the negative numbers make their way into this"

You're actually hitting on something really interesting there, which is that it seems negative numbers are impossible to categorify. To understand this note that the class of finite sets (to say it set-theoretically) with disjoint union and cartesian product on it yields addition and multiplication of natural numbers if one forgets about other set-theoretic properties (and in particular the functions between finite sets) and only considers sets up to their isomorphism class (so as equivelnt if a bijection exists between them). In category-theoretic terms this means that the category of finite sets is a categorification of the natural numbers and, inversely, that the natural numbers are a decategorification of finite sets…</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> What's interesting now is that no similar such structure seems to exist that would be a categorification of the integers. Indeed, it is much simpler to categorify the positive rational numbers or even positive reals than negative numbers. I have my own theory about that: I think we are usually interested in negative numbers to model inputs of processes, such as the money required to do something. In category theory, a process can be identified with a morphisms →. If one starts with a category, I hold that it is not necessary to consider negative numbers, one can just assign to each morphism a source that is a finite set and a target that is a finite set, and two morphisms f, g can be composed if and only if the source of g is equal to the target of f (or, in a more involved setup, if they overlap partially: s(g) = t(f). Note that if we decategorify this, so that s(g) and t(f) are natural numbers, corresponding to some in- and output quantities, then that means exactly that s(g) - t(f) = 0. So I kind of think if one starts with a category, then negative quantities aren't necessary anymore, since they are usually only useful to model inputs of processes that then can be assigned directly. I hope that was decently understandable.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "But aren't these theories all tautological"

Well, what do you mean by a theory being tautological? I thought you meant that every structure is a model for that theory. But there are lots of, say, magmas that aren't semigroups, or lots of semigroups that aren't commutative.

"However, this reading maybe involves accepting or understanding that the model is an ∃x (i.e. the moment you propose a model, M, every object in the model could be entered into the theory as ∀O∈M∃O,"

Careful there, a theory is defined relative to a signature of symbols that can be used to construct sentences from it, and the constant M corresponding to a model isn't part of that signature (at least usually it isn't and I don't think it can be).

"I'll take a look at that pdf…"

Great to hear you're open to a different perspective!</p>

Well this would be a meta-theory (a theory of a theory and model together) so M doesn't exist T but that doesn't stop us from creating another theory that says there is an equivalence class on all other theory-model pairs such that Existance can be pulled into and out of T.</p>

As I'm thinking about it more, I like (((∅:∅):∅)):∅):∅ <- ((∅:∅):∅):∅) <- (∅:∅):∅) <- ∅:∅ more and more as a categorification of negative, I'm just not certain of how to interpret ∅:∅ as a theory opposed to a model (like ∅:∅ as a mode is straightforward, its a model that contains the empty theory and empty model)... but it has the feel of something interesting to me (and its wonky like negative numbers are as well). As for ∅:∅ as nothing, I would say that its not so much nothing as '0' --- which is nothing interpreted as a 'one' in philosophical speak (i.e. its both nothing and the name for nothing, which inflates it to a bit more than nothing). I think ∅: (empty theory, no model including not even the empty model) is nothing proper.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> how do you feel about this? Something I gathered from Houlgates podcast. Am I right in this understanding which gets me to being vanishing into nothing?

We have something in mind that 'is' such as a table. Then we subtract the thing, the table, giving us pure being but that just gives us nothing because there's nothing there anymore, therefore being has just turned into nothing.

If this is correct tho I don't see how nothing goes back to being.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> So based off what I'm saying, nothing goes back into being because of its indifference to itself (i.e. the empty theory is indifferent to the empty model, it will accept it or be satisfied by it). Or another way to put it that if you have 'nothing' you still have a 'one' because you have 'nothing' and nothing is indifferent to or will accept this one.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> yeah, I'm sorry I don't think I was very clear. What I got out of our discussion was that its important to think of Nothing as a totality to understand why being has to explode out of it. So if Nothing is a totality, then that means we end up with these two axioms: En (exists nothing) and ∀x, n ≠ x (this is the indifference of nothing, whatever x is, nothing isn't it) and together these imply that n ≠ n which is a contradiction in the case where nothing is a totality (i.e. where nothing is a determination that follows the LEM). But if its a contradiction then it generates every possible thing which means that it generates being.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Actually I'll take it even further...

n = (∀x, n ≠ x) (i.e. the mere statment that nothing is indifferent is the sum total of what nothing is because it couldn't be anything else, i.e. what Alex said, this is the determination of n and that determination is *all* that n is). However, it is also the case that in fact ∀x, n ≠ x so therefore: ∃n which means that n ≠ n.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Seems to me you Alex think that Hegel would have talked in the mathematical/logical language you both are if it existed in his time and thats why his writing is so obtuse and can be easier understood, or more clearly expressed this way. Maybe, I'm not so sure, I think you can understand it without it just takes time. But we'll see.</p>

I tried that and was punished

"btw what is your meaning of totality here? Is it a mathmatical/logical term or a Philisophical one? Where can I read something about this this? "

It's both logical and philosophical and its developed above (i.e. I'm not pulling from anyone in particular I'm just pointing out that LEM implies a totality in that it is basically saying that every determination we *already* have is sufficient to describe every possible state: we can exclude middles because we already have all possible in-between states described in our logical system: or else our logical system is contradictory in some way --- of course the actual answer, as is usually the case, is that if we have a total system, then it is contradictory because of incompleteness).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> "En (exists nothing) and ∀x, n ≠ x" 

Well, that would be a contradiction, "totality" or not, but in that case you couldn't apply it to ZFC because in ZFC an object exists that is "nothing", namely the empty set ∅. If you use ∅ itself as a model though, the first axiom isn't fulfilled: nothing might certainly exist, but it doesn't exist *in* nothing, so again you don't arrive at a contradiction and can't magically create all of everything from nothing.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> Well, except that a theory can't make statements about itself. Furthermore, if "nothing as a theory" would be "n = (∀x, n ≠ x)", then it wouldn't have an axiom and thus would not be the empty theory. You gotta make up your mind, either "nothing" is the empty theory, in which case it doesn't make any assumptions about its models, or it is a theory that contains a sentence, in which case the identification with ∅ from ZFC falls apart.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Actually I think I can put this in category theoretic terms...

If T1:M1 and T2:M1 then T1 and T2 are often termed 'consistent' --- this makes sense for example (∀x, x = 2):{2} and (∀x, x even):{2} are consistent with each other. A futher point is that when we merge these theories we also get a consistent theory --- i.e. [(∀x, x = 2),  (∀x, x even)] is a totally happy and self-consistent theory.

However for  ∅,  n = (∀x, n ≠ x) :∅ and ∀x, n ≠ x :∅ which means that [n = (∀x, n ≠ x) , ∀x, n ≠ x] *should* be consistent... but it isn't. This is the inconsistency of ∅ stated in category theoretic terms.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Because I can say that because ∄x, x = n:∅ there's a kind of equivalence class such that ∅ = ∄x, x = n. Meaning that it should be the case that I can go n = (∀x, n ≠ x):∄x, x = n ... which is inconsistent. Its about the simultaneous movement through the ':' barrier and equivalent consistency of theories on a single model that causes the contradiction.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Well, basically, yes, though he might have written introduction books that use a simpler language, but when he'd develop his theory itself I'm hoping at least he'd use strict vocabulary. Also note how often Hegel uses mathematical expressions or references mathematics throughout the book, we'll see a lot of that going forward. But formalization is also important because it removes ambiguity, so even if it's not clear what Hegel was saying, we can at least make clear what we are thinking Hegel is saying and trace the differences in that. For me, a lot of the Hegelese that has come up in the last century is a kind of defensive reaction to the analytics' dismissal of Hegel by taking things that I regard as cumbersome necessities for formulating his theory in his time and going "yeah, that's right, and that's what's good about them!". Like, "yeah, it doesn't make sense, and that's why it's actually genius!" or "yeah, it's logically incoherent, and that's why it's a theory of everything!".</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> As I like to quip, Hegel called his book "Science of Logic", not "Heuristics for Politics", which most Marxists seem to want to view it as. But I'm trying my hardest to not use challenging vocabulary in general. This discussion though is about minutiae that with a cursory glance seem plausible strung together to reach metaphysical conclusions so we really have to go through them with a fine tooth come.</p>

A total theory is a theory where every implication from the axioms of the theory is forced into the the theory (so rather than every statement being provable, every statement occurs on the theory side of T:M). And then the point is that there is no Total consistent theory of ∅ which contains all the satisfying theories of ∅ which in terms of predictability I don't think applies to {2} (i.e. there is some kind of determination there).</p>

This actually exists in discourse among logicians. I think it's called the *syntactic closure* <T> of a theory T: you start with T, then add every logical interference from the axioms in T to <T>. Note that <T> is often not recursively enumerable though, or, in other words, often there can't exist an algorithm that lists every axiom in <T>. This is basically a restatement of the incompleteness theorem.

"And then the point is that there is no Total consistent theory of ∅ which contains all the satisfying theories of ∅"

Sure there is: simply list every sentence A of every signature S without constants such that A doesn't start with an existence quantifier ∃x:… . Those are infinitely many sentences, but I think the set in question is even recursively enumerable in the sense that you can write an algorithm that if running for infinitely long produces every such sentence at some point.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> It might be recursively enumerable but my point is that if you list these sentences you end up with an existence anyway because of the statement:  ∀n, n nothing (n = (∀x, n ≠ x)) --- I think I can also list it without the for all (i.e. because it is an if and only if without a claim to existence it would satisfy ∅) so that the syntactic closure of ∅ would have to include ∃n, n ≠ n.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I feel like I'm having trouble with your notation. When you write "∀n, n nothing (n = (∀x, n ≠ x))", do you mean

"For all n, if n is nothing, then n is equal to the set of all x that aren't equal to n"? Do I parse that correctly?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Hmmm, still a problem. Its because you can include some ∃ if you protect them. So If I take this statement and unroll it a bit: (∀x, n ≠ x) -> ∃n and (∃x, n = x) -> ∄n... 

Okay, I know what's going on here -- if you perform your syntactic closure *and* you add to that closure the notion that n = ∅ (i.e. you add the determination of indetermineness) then it falls apart: i.e. its syntactic closure over ∅ + n = ∅ that equals a contradictory theory. (I think that the statement would have to be withdrawn as satisfying because both sides of the negation end up have an existence in them if you re-kerjigger them). My problem is that Hegel is trying to come up with syntactic closure for being so that means that this determination of indeterminateness has to be included on the theory side or else what he's saying doesn't make sense, however, it also means that what he's saying doesn't make sense unless you accept contradictions as real objects that can be manipulated in the theory.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> So n here is supposed to function both as a theory and as a structure, correct? As a theory, given by a set of axioms, it contains only one, which says that "For all x it holds that x is not equal to n". 

So first off, let's note that generally speaking, you can't have a theory with axioms that refer to the theory. Otherwise, you can form theories like the theory T consisting of one axiom "T does not apply to this model". If you do that, then T applies to any model it doesn't apply to. In other words, you can reformulate the liar's paradox. But you could still try to apply T to the empty set. But for the sentence above to be a sentence, n would have to be a constant, and if the theory contains a constant, it can't apply to the empty set because the constant has to be mapped to something (I was actually slightly wrong before when I said that "emptiness" is a model for any theory that doesn't contain axioms that start with an existence quantifier, sorry, the theory can't be in a signature that contains any constants, because those would always have to be mapped to elements in a model per definition of an interpretation"). Finally though, if n is the empty set, it can't as a theory, contain a sentence, because that would be an element of n and therefore n couldn't be the empty set.

So I think you have several problems with this.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> Well, I'm not against treating contradictions as objects, the question is objects in what context? A natural number is not the same thing as a real number is not the same thing as a model is not the same thing as a sentence is not the same thing as a contradiction. All of these are objects *in some context* but each time the context is different.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I find it impossible to derive meaning from the mathematical logical proofs that you’re all talking about - which isn’t a diss or an own - but as an active party member I need more than just hard science and hard logic to convince someone that they need to change the mode of production under capitalism.
I need more of a “we can do it” attitude that’s rooted in serious logical rigour, otherwise I would be railing against capitalists, rather than trying to change capitalism.
This is probably the best lesson I’ve learned from Cutrone. Though the party fucking hates Adorno 😂</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@dve.h_37844#0</span> If you only understand them "on some level", then I'd say rather say ignore them completely. Part of why I'm doing this is because it's very easy to be misguided by something that sounds plausible. I'd rather you avoid all of that than take in something you don't really understand because it sounds good and maybe supports your ideological preconceptions. I don't expect *Science of Logic* to be immediately politically relevant any more than I would expect a biology textbook to be: of course you should have biologists in your movement, and logicians alike, but a training in either won't tell you how to build a socialist movement. I'm following this reading group because I'm personally interested, attempts like Badiou's to "prove" revolution are anathema to me, as they cheapen both theoretical and political work. Insofar as *SoL*'s usefulness for the left is concerned it is mostly because Marx read him and thus subsequent Marxists did, so it might be easier to read their works with it in the background, but the work itself I don't think is useful in anything but explaining logic and setting up later thinking of Hegel, and we all know Hegel was a full-throated supporter of the nation state, so it doesn't seem his logic made his politics particularly secure.</p>

This is probably the best lesson I’ve learned from Cutrone. Though the party fucking hates Adorno 😂"

This though makes me question what you learned from Cutrone. We've had "Yes we Can" for 16 years now. What makes you think you can transcend capitalism? Why would your party not simply be another funnel siphoning up the hopes and efforts of its members to continue an elaborate pyramid scheme? If we're gonna talk Cutrone, let's talk Cutrone:

"Workers are seldom in the position to indulge in the enthusiasms of true belief. But the Left are nothing if not true believers— they can afford their illusions, however disposable they prove to be, blown from one passing fad to the next. The working class knows the difference between entertainment and real life. The Left are hucksters — who are themselves the most easily bamboozled. But socialism will not be a swindle — that is, if it is not merely another capitalist ideology. “Socialism” today is just that, what Marx criticized ruthlessly as a pernicious illusion of capitalism by another name."

[Dogmatization and Thought Taboos on the "Left"]

Why would that not apply to your party? Do you think he was only talking about woke college kids?

Consider this though: maybe it's just currently not possible to transcend capitalism. Maybe it will never be again. Maybe the moment has passed or maybe there never was actually a moment. The greatest thing the socialist movement could do was flip a backward aristocracy, not very impressive on the global scale of things. 

And Cutrone will openly say that, btw. He'll say that maybe there never was an opportunity. He *thinks* there was, but he doesn't know. Nobody knows. And he'll also say that maybe he's doing now theory for people forty years down the line, like Adornos message in a bottle…</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I've personally misled people by convincing them to vote for Bernie. I'll eat some crow for that, unlike pretty much everyone of the public speakers of that movement. I funneled their efforts into a movement that only used them to re-establish capitalist politics. I made a mistake. 

But this is going to repeat. Again and again. With the same rationality: well, we gotta do something! We have to try this thing, or that thing or whatever. Have we thought about if any of them work? No, but, "we can do it!". If we only believe hard enough we can make it happen. 

I'm with Benjamin Studebaker: to move forward, we have to first embrace the despair of the current moment.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Bear in mind that Chris and Benjamin are not politically active. That’s why they get so much shit. They just don’t have any interest in building the party, which as they’ve both pointed out, is a different task from what they are doing as intellectuals. And they are kind of deuchy. So deuchy in fact that no party would ever have them. So they’ve burned that bridge(maybe not Benjamin) - but I still like listening to them.
It is also, in Chris’ case the absolute height of deuchery and hypocrisy to say what he says. It’s a bad look, but worse than Chris thinks, I think.
I still like him for what he puts out as an intellectual, but he lacks almost every skill necessary to be politically active. Or he just doesn’t care.
Like if you’re going to basically do a new rendition of Adorno in May ‘68 and expect to get away with that, politics isn’t the place for you.
What he said about “the left” and Hamas was so just the epitome of poor timing.

SOL may just be philosophical rigour for young people. A right of passage into higher academia, but I would prefer to understand it on a more human level than on a mathematical one.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@dve.h_37844#0</span> "Embracing the despair how though?" 

There was a quick moment of reflection there. It's a shame to see it immediately closed off by arguments. 

"Bear in mind that Chris and Benjamin are not politically active."

That's not true. Cutrone has started the Campaign for a Socialist Party. He just keeps it separate from his intellectual work.

"My party has comrades in it all over the world. You think I’m going to stop supporting them because Benjamin Studebaker says so? Should I tell my comrades in Haiti to “embrace the dispair”?"

Why do you think communism doesn't hold much sway in the developing world? Could it be that those people have been sold false hope once too often.

"Irregardless of all this blather though, the number 1 rule is standing with the oppressed. It just is."

You'd actually owe it particularly to the most oppressed to have a sober understanding of the situation and put some thought into how to fix it.

"I would caution against developing your mental fortitude  before engaging with any political organization."

We certainly take very different things from Cutrone.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@dve.h_37844#0</span> To answer the question though: terrible things are going to happen and there will be nothing we can do about it for the longest time. A political organization that could seriously threaten capitalism will need a lot of time to be build, years at least, probably decades. Embracing the despair means that you have to be clear about that the work you're putting into politics might not pay off in your lifetime or might never pay off and not falling to blind actionism, which is usually counterproductive. What we need to do is basically develop a parallel society in which participation carries an advantage for the individual. On a social level, as opposed to an intellectual one, this will have to start by solving immediate social problems and will have to remain isolated from polarized political issues for some time. Though concrete crisis points will be unpredictable, the large-scale trends that will trigger crises, such as climate change are somewhat predictable, so they can be planned for. Apart from that, Cutrone noted that a lot of immediate work will not look like political work at all and that one of the first things we need to do is get some perspective on the working class and what it actually thinks by, basically, hanging out with that, and Derick Varn would note that Lenin already recommended having a working understanding of all social classes, what they think and how they are motivated, and, again, that can only be had by having met them.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> No I mean, the party IS where you learn. That is its purpose. I’m just cautioning against joining something before you have a stance on it. You should do both at once imo because that’s the point of the party for the working class.

Trotsky said that all one needs is the desire for socialism to be a socialist. If you’ve got that, you should join. Don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes or not knowing enough because that’s gonna keep happening.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@dve.h_37844#0</span> It's a campaign for a party, and it's fairly hard to find information on it. The last I know is that he mentioned it maybe half a year or a year ago as a project that was kind of hamstrung by the Bernie campaign and that he would now again devote more resources to. But I don't think he wants all that much information about it out there, except how to reach them if you want to join.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I’ll just say this and then get back to Hegel:
Starting from the point of the realization that you(or I) are politically useless is not something that you need to understand before you enter politics. I think you should develop this as you work through politics, as Marx did. 
Ones contradictions should be worked through with people and theory, rather than with theory alone.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Im just reading vol 1 of Houlgate's "Hegel on Being" and Im pretty surprised to learn that according to him Hegel thinks that the categories are acquired through language and as babies before we learn language we only perceive light impressions through our senses that aren't conceptualised as objects yet.

"initially the child has only a sensation of light by which things are manifested to it." (EPM 56 / 80 [§ 396 A])

 To me, if this is the case, this seems like a sharp distinction from Kant who Id assumed thought we were primordially equipped with categories and concepts of space and time such that we would perceive something we see as an object as soon as we opened our eyes. Also that language is of such fundamental importance to Hegel too seems to lend credit to the linguistic turn in the 20th century.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Personally I actually find it a bit far fetched 😄  I find it hard to believe babies dont have some concepts pre-language because they show clear signs of intelligence and comprehension before they can speak, at least verbal communication anyway.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> Yes I totally agree with you, I reject the idea of vaguely understanding Hegel to get a 'flavour' of what he's saying or something and I can see the merit in using logical vocabulary, just as I think diagrams are very helpful too. I can't follow what you and Thomas are talking about really at all because I think I'd need to spend a good while, maybe even years reading logic or maths and were reading this book now so I dont have the time to do that.
I do however think that just by pointing out where Hegel and Logic/maths correspond, doesnt mean youve necessarily grasped those concepts and I think that you should be able to communicate them in normal language to an extent as well. Not that I'm saying thats all you and Thomas are doing, I have no idea what the extent of your comprehension of Hegel is yet, especially tho when you say it in terminology I dont understand. Maybe it should be a requisite to read Logic/Maths to read Philosophy though.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> are you talking about there being multiple totalities? I think I've heard that Hegel is concerned with the totality but by this he doesnt mean the totality of everything, only the totality of our horizon perhaps?
Are you saying totality is a contradiction because to define a totality is to delineate it meaning something is left out and it isn't actually a totality afterall?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think Hegel is not actually needed to comprehend what Marx is saying. But I do think it gives you insight into how he thinks politically, and that is quite valuable. Dialectics was something that many great politicians liked, even MLK Jr., and they used the lessons of Hegel to strengthen their rational political core, so I kind of think that the legacy of Hegel is in politics.
So thinking about logic mathematically might not be the intended learning outcome here. 

I wouldn’t say it’s a mistake, but like, there’s a reason we’re haunted by this guy.
You don’t have to be a Marxist, but I think there are things that Marx says that are pretty much unquestionable in capitalism.</p>

It’s obvious who Marx comes in service of, so I think you can trust him.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Right.
When people ask me “how is Marx scientific?” I usually say “because his notion of science is not limited to the objective world, but also the subjective world”. I’m probably misleading people a bit but they join up and seem to like what we’re offering 🤣</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Tbh, he's not that different from a lot of Marxists that I've met. Most Trotskyists think 90% like him. But he allows himself to be more critical of the Marxist parties from without, so he gets to be all witty and cool. That probably wouldn't fly in the party because of party unity and all that.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> So do most Marxists. Take Chris' debate with Mike McNair of the CPGB: both of them are right for different reasons, and they both knew exactly what the other was talking about.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> This is an example of a sentence that I think could be more clearly expressed in a neat logical expression.

"Nothing is usually opposed to something; but the being of something is already determinate and is distinguished from another something; and so therefore the nothing which is opposed to the something is also the nothing of a particular something, a determinate nothing."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> <@638122715668152320> Hegel says in the first remark of Being that in the words non-being and nothing "both being and its negation are enunciated in a single term". But he also says "as it is in becoming" which is not true. Is this a translation thing? Does the word werden (translated to becoming) contain being and its negation?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> its this bit that threw me

"both being and its negation are enunciated in a single term, nothing, as it is in becoming."

I thought hes saying being and its negation are contained in the word nothing, as they are also in the word becoming.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> ok I think I get it now. Being and its negation are contained in the 'word' nothing (and non-being) as they are also contained in the 'concept' becoming, not the word becoming.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> As I said at the end, although I got it a bit muddled, I still think there may be a subtle difference between Becoming and Determinate Being. I think Determinate being is Becoming taken in its immediacy. Becoming is dynamic whereas Determinate Being is Becoming taken as being fixed by the understanding.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> in fact, in the 3rd paragraph of 'Determinate Being' Hegel says so himself

§ 191
From becoming there issues determinate being, which is the simple oneness of being and nothing. Because of this oneness it has the form of immediacy. Its mediation, becoming, lies behind it; it has sublated itself and determinate being appears, therefore, as a first, as a starting-point for the ensuing development. It is first of all in the one-sided determination of being; the other determination, nothing, will likewise display itself and in contrast to it.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> the way I'm seeing it atm is that becoming is the third term in the dialectic of Being, it has to change to Determinate Being in order to become the first term of the next dialectic, Determinate being. Each dialectic starts out with something immediate and is sublated to something mediated through Reason, it has to again be taken as fixed and immediate by the understanding to become the first term in the next dialectic.

The book thats really helped me to see it this way is David Gray Carlson - A Commentary on Hegel's Science of Logic which is where I got the bromian knot diagrams.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> The first three.

I heard Terry Pinkard once say about philosophy that it’s like trying to find your way around a room that you can’t see in. And so Hegel starts in the dark room, with nothing, and then shows you how to make something out of nothing.
For me the difference between nothing and being is the first important step, then the next step is to realize that even in understanding that there is a difference, it doesn’t actually get you anywhere. Difference just kind of is. And so you have to speculate that they’re the same. And in so doing you realize they’re the same and different and that this still doesn’t get you anywhere. So finally you have to arrive at the conclusion, out of necessity, that they’re related in becoming their opposite because they’re the same. That it’s really becoming - what we call determinate being, or being that is arrived at through the process of logical thought, that is the grounding for knowing anything. And so with that confidence you can begin to think, or feel your way out of the room.</p>

You could read Marx’s critique of Hegel’s philosophy of right. Or The Poverty of Philosophy(critique of Proudhon) to get a better idea of where he’s coming from before he starts writing capital.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> <@476561351167311872> One thing came up in the stream about materialism vs. idealism that I didn't have time to address --- I was not saying that materialism = an infinitely growing and complex list of meditations that make contact with the thing in itself impossible. Rather, that is an idealist send-up of the materialist point I was making: that you do reach a point where you are no longer mediating but that point is a pure contradiction. The difference between the first and second being that the mediating list assumes that there is always a further mediation to grant meaning and connection to the previous signifiers in the chain, while in what I was saying there is a terminating contradiction which is meaningless in its content (because it is a contradiction) and which causes the whole chain to lose its quality of meaning --- i.e. in the idealist send up we have 'everything is caused by something else' *period* while in the actual materialist structure you end up with 'everything is caused by something else, except the contradiction'. That is what is meant, for me at least, by the phrase 'the contradiction is the thing-in-itself' --- there is no thing-in-itself, we slam into a contradictory oscillation, as opposed to the idealist send up which still assumes a non-contradictory thing-in-itself in the very process of its infinite mediating chain (i.e. the mediating chain attempts to prove that we actually are totally cut off from the thing-in-itself in that it has no impact on the rest of the chain: however we do contact it in the form of a contradiction). This was the disagreement that Alex and I were having about completeness, contradiction, and totality --- my claim was that if you encounter such an infinite mediating chain then you are dealing with a contradiction and you're allowed to say as much.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I'm on A - Determinate being as such.
Haven't found it too terribly difficult yet. But we'll see how I do on B and C.
What I determined from the first chapter was that the flow of the book is actually supposed to make you feel lost, since he's walking you through how to think.
And so I've kind of embraced the void.

I also re-read Marx's 18th Brumaire this month in preparation for a short speech that I gave on Lenin's Rights of Nations to Self Determination.
As the Platypus pedagogues have pointed out numerous times, understanding the dialectic of the revolutionary party and the working class is extremely important in helping us all understand capitalism's "freedom problem" and how we might solve it.
So, I've made it my duty to get a firm grasp on dialectical thinking and, tbh, it's really paying off; I leave the wittiest comments imaginable on Gabriel Rockhill videos now!</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@dve.h_37844#0</span> I would rather argue that its supposed to be understandable, as Houlgate says in this chapter I'm reading "Nonetheless, despite its abstractness, Hegel’s account of quality and determinate being is clear and precise."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Well, my answer to that would be the *feeling* of being lost, or, being in a necessary meditative state, while reading the chapter is an outcome of Hegels’ precision, with one caveat: it need not be outside of the academy (in which he taught).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Like, his descriptions are great. But that doesn’t mean getting the point is going to be easy. The book was designed to teach logic through the act of rigorous thinking.
It’s a weird thing to read in a capitalist society post-Marx. But if we understand how to historically place it, then we can get some insight into why this was necessary for the society that Hegel thought he was living in, and take it seriously.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Its certainly not easy but it can be made easier by having a firm foundation in German idealism I think (something I havent got) and I believe its sensible to read other peoples interpretations too, otherwise its like reinventing the wheel!</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Oh, I just mean because the book is academic in nature, it’s going to naturally try to prove something as precisely as possible.
If you want to understand the nature of reality in other ways, or how to be in the world, you don’t need Hegel for that.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@dve.h_37844#0</span> I agree in a way. I totally think you can deepen your understanding of his writing away from it through letting it seep into you. I don't think Hegel claimed he wanted to show how to be in the world necessarily tho.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> I actually do Terravada. What I've found interesting in my practice is how much lower my stress levels have gotten since taking a rigorous approach to Marxist theory and practice. I think less about how I feel because I spend more time reading and writing - in fact it's kind of fucked up my daily practice and I do it maybe two or three times a week now haha</p>

I do actually find the ideas quite scary, but the practice of it is what keeps me grounded. It's like what John Kabat Zinn called "full catastrophy living"</p>

> 
> 3. Being-for-other is the indeterminate, affirmative community of something with its other; in the limit the non-being-for-other becomes prominent, the qualitative negation of the other, which is thereby kept apart from the something which is reflected into itself. We must observe the development of this Notion, which manifests itself, however, rather as an entanglement and a contradiction. This contradiction is at once to be found in the circumstance that the limit, as something's negation reflected into itself, contains ideally in it the moments of something and other, and these, as distinguished moments, are at the same time posited in the sphere of determinate being as really, qualitatively distinct.</p>

Side note: I think there is something to his use of the word "reflection", I wonder what the German word that is being used there is?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> So this is the important line for resolution vs. contradiction for me --- its section 252 (Hegel doesn't quite 'define' contradiction, but there is a development here):

"With this nothing, however, which is supposed to be only nothing, and which at the same time is granted an existence in thought, imagination or speech, there occurs the same contradiction as has just been indicated in connection with the finite, but with this difference, that in the case of that first nothing it only occurs, whereas in finitude it is explicitly stated. There it appears as subjective; here it is asserted that the finite stands perpetually opposed to the infinite, that what is in itself null is, and is as in itself null. We have to become conscious of this; and the development of the finite shows that, having this contradiction present within it, it collapses within itself, yet in doing so actually resolves the contradiction, that not only is the finite transitory and ceases to be, but that the ceasing-to-be, the nothing, is not the final determination, but itself ceases to be."

He goes on in the infinite to develop this dialectic of contradiction and resolution --- as far as I can tell contradiction appears in resolution and resolution is a taking up of the contradiction as a positive object at every step he performs this operation.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Also the logic of the democrats as armor --- is very interesting to me because I feel like the response might actually be 'yes but the point of defeating the armor (obstacle) is not *to become* the armor but rather to figure out how to disolve it'. The guy wasn't wrong in thinking that we need to *something* about the democrats (or that the path forward must run *through* the democrats) but 'runs through' is maybe meant to be like in the phrase 'a sword runs through armor'.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> I mean, that was what the Bernie campaigns were supposed to be: a single concentrated attack that would cut through the armor. But we ended up becoming the armor instead. What should we do differently? It's hard to say, and I think we're far from actually mounting any considerable attack on capitalism at the moment, but I'll just say what Cutrone and also Studebaker like to say about these things, which is that even if we, as independent socialists, would see it necessary to participate in politics through the two party system, it would necessarily be one that runs candidates in both parties.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> So I don't think this breaks the original metaphore, just that we have to see that the bernie campaign wasn't what we thought it was... the problem was that there was no sword to stab through the armor of the democrats at the time of the campaign (bernie as a personality notwithstanding --- he wasn't such a sword himself). Such a sword, in my thinking, is the worker's firm directed by the worker's party (which didn't and still doesn't exist). So yeah, the metaphore breaks down if instead of using a sword you just like... hit it with a hammer.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The original point with saying that Hegel does not define contradiction what that contradiction is not a moment of the movement of Logic. It's either considered not necessary for the movement or not yet able to be elaborated. Or both. The whole idea of building a metaphysics of contradiction seems bizarre to me; contradictions are extremely mediated by what are in contradiction. It feels like a distraction, adding confusion, and fools errand to try to be defining contradiction.
The passage you quote as "developing" contradiction, it says is a repitition of the contradiction of Being and Nothing, in chap 1; and the word nullity on German is "Nichtiges", adjective of night, nothing.
Both "contradictions" he says are of the understanding; that is being *appears* rigidly separate from nothing. Finite "stands perpetually opposed to the infinite"; 
if you read it in context, he is saying with the last sentence that the understanding is wrong in perpetually opposing them. That the contradiction is subjective, for us, for the understanding.

Anyway. It's just not about contradiction it's about finitude.</p>

He's not "bad poet" like Thomas said. He is extremely precise and it simply takes the discipline to *not* introduce pre-conecieved ideas into his text in order to understand it</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> If there's any representation thought of contradiction, it seems like it would be the unity of opposites; the dialectic of opposition as not rigidly separate but also not identical, united and different. And in this unity, a becoming of a third.
The unity of Being and Nothing become existence; and similarly in repitition, we the Something and Other are united in Being-for-itself.
In the shorter logic, he says "Being-for-itself ... As the relation of the negative to itself it is a being that is for itself, the One"; he goes on to discuss it as "the One", "it does not relate as something does to other but instead, as the unity of something and an other".

This unity creates contradiction for the understanding because looking  at the opposition as such, their unity seems impossible. But their opposition is sublated in the unity, it's still there, but  not visible.

I think to translate it into set theory or something is not only to mediate it from outside; it also, to me seems to be trying to flatten it in a single understanding. To use a spacial metaphor; I think the understanding is like a 2 dimensional snapshot, and dialectics is trying to understand things in 3 dimensions. So we see a couple 2-d images and see things which appear contradictory and have to Reason into the depth, the third dimension, to see how the contradiction is only apparent, ie resolves</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Lawvere treated the issue of unities of opposites:

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Aufhebung

However, he doesn't require contradictions. This goes to the fact that opposites aren't contradictions. Warm and cold are opposites but an object can be both warm and cold at the same time. Two points of a line are opposite to each other but unified in the line. This is already formally strictly described by Lawvere's formalism. No, a contradiction is in fact more similar to a boundary: an unstable point at which two things that generically exclude each other are momentarily existent at the same time. My go-to example are the vacuum states of the universe: it is not a given that our vacuum is a global energy minimum. At each moment, a piece of spacetime could reach a lower vacuum through quantum fluctuations. In this case, the resulting lower vacuum would either collapse almost immediately or spread with near light speed and destroy everything in its path.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I definitely do think this is what Hegel is doing.
The attempt to translate his system into formal concepts defeats the point to me; however interesting it might be for some as an intellectual exercise.

I just don't get it, what is the attraction??</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The problem with boundary is that there is no boundary between finite and infinite.
I can elaborate my understanding of that section later; I have no idea how one would capture it in formalism.

To me, formalism is always in the realm of Understanding. Reason has left the picture, however necessary it was to develop the formalism; it is now a static system</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Formalism is the mind of God, it is truth becoming aware of itself, it is both technique and its study, and it is in every page of Hegel's book. You will never see Hegel bitch against it for he knew of its importance, and indeed a lot of the concepts he's talking about have been formalized, independently or through Lawvere/Schreiber. Those who can't see the formalism in Hegel are mathematically illiterate, those who reject it are fetishizing the worst aspects of Hegel: as he was wresting objects from the darkness at considerable intellectual effort they are celebrating the darkness and ignoring the object. The rejection of formalism was a counterreaction against the analytics, it can't stand to their demands for formal rigor so it tries to deny its necessity. But only rigorous thought can be trusted to be true and only formalized thought can be trusted to concern something true. Insofar as something is true in the science of logic, it can be formalized, because that's what logic is: the formalization of thought.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Of course, finitude and infinity are mathematical concepts, as is that of a boundary, and the relation between at least finitude and Hegel's bad infinity can easily be captured using Peano's axioms and some elementary topological considerations.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Note that Hegel identifies the "bad infinity" with the infinity of "Verstand", which is what would most closely translate to reason in English, whereas the other infinity is that of "Vernunft", which is more closely translated to "rationality".</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> So it's exactly the other way around to what one would think: it's not the "good" reason against the "bad" rationality with the former being the light of the spirit and the latter being the bean-counter's perspective on the world, not at all.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I'd also add until the above comment I didn't think there was much here to Hegel other than some blather about how nothing exists. I could read any obscurantist to get that. Okay, maybe that's too strong - but something around there. Maybe it's just that Hegel is being read by people so steeped in Postmodernism that everything comming out the other end is encomia to postmodern relativism.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@angelus888#0</span> That's probably what I would have thought too had I not been exposed to Lawvere before actually looking into Hegel (Lawvere is pretty famous among category theorists), but it's really not that. It's actually surprising what a firm grip Hegel had of logical and mathematical concepts of his time and even to some extent in anticipation. There are constant allusions to mathematics, some explicit, some more implicit but clearly noticeable, and overall his deductions are, for the most part, fairly careful. There are some where I'm not sure how he arrives there, but so far nothing that was central to his arguments. I read a bit ahead and there are fairly involved mathematical arguments he makes later on about infinitesimal calculus. It is kind of impressive. I don't know that any philosopher after him had such a good grasp of logic and mathematics. Russell and Whitehead would be candidates, but I'm much less impressed with Russell's philosophical contributions and Whitehead was a mathematician first and foremost and a philosopher second.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> It's telling to me that you have to distort what I'm saying as though I see no value in formalization where I am merely trying to point out the limits of formalization.

One can formalize something only after it's understood, after it's thought through. So to say Logic merely is formalization of thought would be to cut out the thinking itself.

A formal system is necessarily mediated. The definition that formalist gives of Being is based in a number of technical concepts elsewhere defined.

It becomes turtles all the way down.

Being for Hegel is conceivable in its Immediacy. And Hegel frequently refers to the immediate of many concepts; ie back to the immediacy of the finite. That passage clearly gives a sense of finite and infinite beyond mathematics.

One has to base ones system of formalization in something else. 

Hegel is actually MORE rigorous than Lawverve's formalization because it's grounded in something more immediate than formalism.

Hegel is developing concepts necessary before one can formalize the way math does. Math assumes too much; or rather, it closes itself off from  thought itself, satisfied w formalizations.
It loses its metaphysical significance, I would say, to translate it into math</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "One can formalize something only after it's understood, after it's thought through. So to say Logic merely is formalization of thought would be to cut out the thinking itself."

No, because one can think without knowing anything without logic. Logic is the comprehension of thought through strict formalization.

"One has to base ones system of formalization in something else."

The same is true for any kind of consideration, really. See also the next point

"Hegel is actually MORE rigorous than Lawverve's formalization because it's grounded in something more immediate than formalism."

No, because Hegel is using language, and language is already a formalization and certainly not immediate or at least no more immediate than, say, a mathematical calculation. That's the unspoken background: that Hegel is not really, and could never, just develop his logic completely out of nothing. He is already using language to define the terms he is using in his system. Also, he is using logical reasoning all the time even when he hasn't set it up yet. He isn't, and cannot, start from nothing, at best he's describing a self-causing system.

"Math assumes too much; or rather, it closes itself off from  thought itself, satisfied w formalizations.
It loses its metaphysical significance."

No one who knows real math could ever say it is closed off from thought. In any case, rather than losing its metaphysical significance, it gives the precise mechanism for why the system Hegel is describing can work at all. The key word here being "precise".</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Verstand in German means the faculty of thinking, pretty closely aligned with the English "reason", except that it doesn't have the dual meaning of "cause" that the English word has. The lexical meaning of Vernunft is similar, but it carries with itself a note of temperation and in colloquial usage is almost never used to refer to the faculty of thinking but rather to the making of reasonable decisions: we would say "Sei vernünftig" to someone on the verge of making a bad decision, similar to "be reasonable". But "use your reason!" would be translated as "Benutz deinen Verstand!".</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> So you're saying the descriptions he gives should not be taken as definitions?

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> ""The whole of Spinoza's philosophy is contained in these definitions, which, however, taken as a whole are formal; it is really a weak point in Spinoza that he begins thus with definitions. In mathematics this method is permitted, because at the outset we there make assumptions, such as that of the point and line; but in Philosophy the content should be known as the absolutely true. It is all very well to grant the correctness of the name-definition, and acknowledge that the word “substance” corresponds with the conception which the definition indicates, but it is quite another question to determine whether this content is absolutely true.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@angelus888#0</span> It's kind of hard to pick, particularly while keeping it approachable. I acutually think the nlab-entry that I linked to before (which wasn't written by him) is a good starting point:

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Aufhebung

Also the beginning of the nlab-entry of Sol:

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Science+of+Logic

In these, as well as the below papers, there might come a point where you can't read any further because of the mathematical jargon (even though Lawvere tries his best to keep it as understandable as possible). I suggest that when you come to that point to skim a bit ahead and if it doesn't get better leave the paper aside for now.

The beginning of "Categories of Space and Quantity" should be fairly understandable and is important, "Unity and Identity of Opposites in Calculus and Physics" https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Unity+and+Identity+of+Opposites+in+Calculus+and+Physics is also important, as well as "Cohesive Toposes and Cantor's "lauter Einsen" https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Cohesive+Toposes+and+Cantor%27s+%22lauter+Einsen%22

I've given links for two of these but I know for a fact that the third is obtainable using the usual means to obtain scientific publications.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> To separate the "steps of reasoning" from its rigor is to limit the concept of rigor to mere formality.

I think this is precisely the impoverished notion of rigor, logic, and truth.

You said before that "only formalized thought can be trusted to concern something true".

That seems in contradiction to what you are saying now; that it's formal but not true.

That's the problem. Formalism does not guarantee truth; nor do I agree it's a condition for apprehending truth. Nor do I think Hegel believes it is; Hegel clearly believes Christianity is true but that he is the first to formalize it.

The value in formalization is in clarifying the truth after it has been apprehended; through such clarity, the truth is increased by specificity and the acknowledgement of it's limits. Any truth taken too far passes into falsity, and formalization & rigor helps identify those limits.

But formalization can do the opposite; for example in Econ of analytic philosophy, formalization obscures the truth by trying to reduce it down to definitions.

Dependence on definitions, to me, is the essence of formalism. That's why I took issue with your claim that Hegel depends on language as formalization. He does not.

In maths, you can depend simply on definitions. The definitions are *precise* and sufficient; not so with meta-physcis/philosophy precisely because it is not a self contained system.

Whereas math is about conceptual constructs which may or may not be applied to the world. Metaphysics is about existence.
That's why Being is not the universal set. The universal set only exists hypothetically in theory.
Being not only exists, it's more fundamental than existence or 'actuality'. 
Actuality, the material world, is grounded in Being. That's why the thought of Being is immediate; because thought exists in the material world, in our brains and minds.
The idea of being partakes in being.

When you divide logic from being, as Maths and bourgeois Econ do, and consider rigor merely to be..</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The strong sense would be to say, what can be true and what isn't true from an argument. But if we are going to be more PoMo about it, at the very least Aristotelian logic points out logical containers that have big holes in them.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Decent discussion without reading the whole goddam Organon. Though I also have to add translation matters for Aristotle. Essentially you can get several different translations for all of the source texts because it seems incredibly condensed. In general it's best to not obsess over mot-a-mot ness but to look for the idea indicated by the combination of words used. This is a bedrock concept of translation in general, which is about the transmission of ideas not words.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Looking at the translations they remind me of translating Classical Chinese, which I am directly familiar with. It's very difficult due to it's compression, style, difference to target language, changes in grammar, and lack of word equivalence. So you are going to shoot for what the text means and how it means it rather than trying to repeat preicse words.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> "*The mathematical method is, however, ill-adapted for speculative content*, and finds its proper place only in the finite sciences of the understanding. In modern times Jacobi has asserted (Werke, Vol. IV. Section I. pp. 217-223) that all demonstration, all scientific knowledge leads back to Spinozism, which alone is a logical method of thought; and because it must lead thither, it is really of no service whatever, *but immediate knowledge is what we must depend on*. It may be conceded to Jacobi that the method of demonstration leads to Spinozism, if we understand thereby *merely the method of knowledge belonging to the understanding*. But the fact is that Spinoza is made a testing-point in modern philosophy, so that it may really be said: You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all. This being so, the mathematical and demonstrative method of Spinoza would seem to be only a defect in the external form; but it is the fundamental defect of the whole position. In this method the nature of philosophic knowledge and the object thereof, are entirely misconceived, for mathematical knowledge and *method are merely formal in character and consequently altogether unsuited for philosophy*. Mathematical knowledge exhibits its proof on the existent object as such, not on the object as conceived; *the Notion is lacking throughout*; the content of Philosophy, however, is simply the Notion and that which is comprehended by the Notion.

Think of the phrase the age of Reason. Reason is higher than the facility of understanding.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Here Hegel explains a bit what he means by Understanding:
"If the t*hought-forms are vitiated by a fixed antithesis, i.e. if they are only of a finite character*, they are unsuitable for the self-centred universe of truth, and truth can find no adequate receptacle in thought. Such thought, which can produce only limited and partial categories and proceed by their means, is what in *the stricter sense of the word is termed Understanding*. The finitude, further, of these categories lies in two points. Firstly, they are only subjective, and the antithesis of an objective permanently clings to them. Secondly, they are always *of restricted content*, and so persist in antithesis to one another and still more to the Absolute."

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@angelus888#0</span> Well, again, in most of these you'll get to a point where reading forward will become hard. If you really want to get into it, you could read "Conceptual Mathematics" first, then the others, which should help you a lot with the Lawvere-papers. I also wrote an exposition here, which I tried to keep readable, but was maybe a bit too optimistic about:

https://github.com/nameiwillforget/hegel-in-mathematics

Note that this, though, is about Schreiber's formalization, which builds on Lawvere's but is a bit different and maybe more speculative.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> "o separate the "steps of reasoning" from its rigor is to limit the concept of rigor to mere formality."

Which I'm not doing. Again, the steps are usually rigorous, the premises aren't.

"You said before that "only formalized thought can be trusted to concern something true".

That seems in contradiction to what you are saying now; that it's formal but not true."

No, though I was admittedly a little unclear for the sake of rhetoric: a conclusion is valid if and only if both its premises and its reasoning steps are. It is necessesary, not sufficient. Although that should really be common knowledge.

"That's the problem. Formalism does not guarantee truth; nor do I agree it's a condition for apprehending truth. Nor do I think Hegel believes it is; Hegel clearly believes Christianity is true but that he is the first to formalize it."

Well, you can believe what you want, though I doubt you are actually acting on your belief. It would be very unreasonable. In any case, I don't see how out of the second sentence it would follow that Hegel didn't believe it.

"The value in formalization is in clarifying the truth after it has been apprehended; through such clarity, the truth is increased by specificity and the acknowledgement of it's limits. Any truth taken too far passes into falsity, and formalization & rigor helps identify those limits."

Well, great. You are forgetting that formalization also helps with further thinking and communication, but, sure, usually you have an insight first (built on your prior vocabulary), then formalize it. And that's what we should do with Hegel.

"But formalization can do the opposite; for example in Econ of analytic philosophy, formalization obscures the truth by trying to reduce it down to definitions."

Again, the problem is not that axioms are taken but that they are supposed but do not correspond to reality.</p>

Except that, well, he does. He uses language to convey his thoughts, which he has has thought about with language and maybe some other intuition, and he reasons logically. I don't see how you could deny that at all.

"In maths, you can depend simply on definitions. The definitions are precise and sufficient; not so with meta-physcis/philosophy precisely because it is not a self contained system."

They are also precise in logic. And logic is metaphysics.

"That's why Being is not the universal set. The universal set only exists hypothetically in theory."

I don't even know what the "universal set" is. It is the terminal object though. Or rather, the terminal object is a structure in our common mathematical theory that corresponds to the metaphysical role of pure being.

"Actuality, the material world, is grounded in Being. That's why the thought of Being is immediate; because thought exists in the material world, in our brains and minds."

Except both Tom and Thomas said pure being cannot be intuited. Which one is it: is it so pure we can't actually comprehend it or is it immediate because it is in us anyway? Regardless, I'll just note that if it's a thought it's not really immediate. Only direct experience is.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Alright, I did some more research and I think the terms were less divergent to in the past. Basically, in German "Vernunft" came to mean more what Kant called "praktische Vernunft" whereas in English "reason" came to mean more what he called "theoretische Vernunft", tendentially.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> I think we have come upon the source of our disagreement which upon clarifying other points will be more clear. You say:
"Regardless, I'll just note that if it's a thought it's not really immediate. Only direct experience is."

This is not true (for Hegel). Hegel lays out the direct experience of thought in the first few paragraphs of the Encyclopedia Logic:

"The objects of philosophy, it is true, are upon the whole the same as those of religion. In both the object is Truth, in that supreme sense in which God and God only is the Truth. ... the mind makes general images of objects, long before it makes notions of them, and that it is only *through these mental images, and by recourse to them, that the thinking mind rises to know and comprehend thinkingly.*

But with the rise of this thinking study of things, it soon becomes evident that thought will be satisfied with nothing short of showing the necessity of its facts, of demonstrating the existence of its objects, as well as their nature and qualities. Our original acquaintance with them is thus discovered to be inadequate."""

So we have the immediacy of thought by holding it in our consciousness as "mental images", however, this does NOT mean they are adequate. But this is clearly a moment for him, one which the pass Tom quote about the immediacy of finite demonstrates; immediacy there means the understanding of finite represented in mental image / understanding shows its inadequacy.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> In parage 2: "Philosophy, on the other hand, is a peculiar mode of thinking — a mode in which thinking becomes knowledge, and knowledge through notions. ... the strictly human and thought-induced phenomena of consciousness do not originally appear in the form of a thought, but as a feeling, a perception, or mental image — all of which aspects must be distinguished from the form of thought proper."

So we have here, most thoughts derive from "a feeling, a perception, or mental image", but must be distinguished from "thought" proper. Paragraph 3:

""The **Content**, of whatever kind it be, with which our consciousness is taken up, is what constitutes the qualitative character of our feelings, perceptions, fancies, and ideas; of our aims and duties; and of our thoughts and notions. From this point of view, feeling, perception, etc., are the **forms **assumed by these contents. The contents remain one and the same, whether they are felt, seen, represented, or willed, and whether they are merely felt, or felt with an admixture of thoughts, or merely and simply thought. In any one of these forms, or in the admixture of several, the contents confront consciousness, or are its **object**.""

...
"The several modes of feeling, perception, desire, and will, so far as we are aware of them, are in general called ideas (mental representations): and it may be roughly said that philosophy puts thoughts, categories, or, in more precise language, adequate notions, in the place of the generalised images we ordinarily call ideas. Mental impressions such as these may be regarded as the metaphors of thoughts and notions. But to have these figurate conceptions does not imply that we appreciate their intellectual significance, the thoughts and rational notions to which they correspond."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> So there is an immediacy of thought, a "direct experience of it". This is a crucial aspect of Hegel's dialectic and what distinguishes it from formalism.

Particularly, what distinguishes it form a reliance on definitions. You continue to conflate use of language with definitions. A definition in math or *formal* logic is when the term is no other than the definition; its completed by it; the definition set the form of the idea and the form determines entirely its content. This has significant limits which I have tried to explain.

What Hegel does is different in that he uses language to construct a mental image or intuition and then clarifies it bit by bit with the Remarks and the rest of the text. These are ways of developing a Notion (admittedly not entirely clear what that means), which is beyond language and at best conveyed, not defined, by it.

How we may come to have a particularly idea in our mind is its mediation, but we just as well may have it immediately *in our mind*.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I’m also not sure that thought can’t be immediate. Once something is sublated I think it becomes immediate again. Or at least that’s how it’s been so far.

Science of Logic, Determinate Being § 191
“From becoming there issues determinate being, which is the simple oneness of being and nothing. Because of this oneness it has the form of immediacy. Its mediation, becoming, lies behind it; it has sublated itself and determinate being appears, therefore, as a first, as a starting-point for the ensuing development.”
https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl109.htm#HL1_109

From what I’ve seen logic proceeds by splitting apart dialectically then through sublation coming together as one again. And as Hegel says above the oneness is what makes it immediate. So things are being mediated and then made immediate again over and over through the course of the logic. At least that’s what’s happened so far from what I’ve read, maybe that will change. I may be wrong.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Im not totally confident about this but I think the final move to immediacy is made by the faculty of the Understanding, the initial Dialectical move by Reason.

another thing ive read in David Gray Carlsons book is that the first step, the immediacy of Being or Determinate Being for Example, is the understanding. The negation of that (Nothing, Negativity) is a move by 'Dialectical Reason' and the third move (Becoming, ??Something?? (im not sure this is right in chapter 2)) is the move of 'Speculative Reason'. I havent seen Hegel say this himself anywhere yet, maybe its in the Encyclopedia.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I absolutely agree things are mediated and then immediate again over and over again in the Logic.
I think the question is what that means .

I think you have it backwards in your first sentence; when something is sublated it moves out of immediacy and becomes a mediated moment in the new thought-object 

The whole passage I was cutting quotes from and explaining is what he means by immediate abstraction: holding pure thoughts in one's awareness. 
That is what I take to be immediacy in the movement from mediation to immediacy and back.

We know becoming through coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be; their unity is becoming. In their unity we can think - hold the thought in our mind - becoming as it's own thought.
Just as coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be are unities of Being and Nothing; being and nothing in them are sublated, ie moments, not the immediate thought held in awareness.

When we try to hold being or Nothing in our mind, they pass into each other.

Here is a key difference between conveying thoughts versus definition.

Hegel refers to the thought of being as "empty intuiting"; that is not what being *is* it's mere how to *think* being. He said "There *is nothing* to be intuited". This is easily misunderstood as that one cannot Intuit it so don't bother; but with metaphysics, you have to be very careful with words like "is" and "nothing". There really *"is"* nothing.

That's exactly how Nothing passes into Being. He says Nothing is "meaningful" and that is why it has Being.

So if for no other content of meaning of Being, we have meaningfulness. 

I would add that Being could be thought as the dialectical unity of Actuality (the whole world, both inner world and outer world) and its opposite, Possibility.
Maybe it's even more than that, idk what that would be.

Being is like "everything -ness" except you have to be careful not to think that in any limiting way. 

So in a sense, it is not Intuitable; trying to think it leads to nothing. But in Nothing, there Being is</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> I've been trying to say this.
This is why formalization has it's limits, it's always of the understanding.
Any formal truth, taken too far becomes untruth; that's where you come to the negation of it.

When I said that concepts change in dialectical logic, Alex acknowledged this historically only.
What I'm trying to convey with the whole point about holding thoughts as the object of ones consciousness is that they necessarily need to change, not only historically, but in our individual minds.

Every time I re-read a previous part of the book having read further, I understand that part much more clearly. I may have understood it formally or literally the first time, but I didn't understand the content of the thought.

Hegel definitely does criticize formalism. He does so precisely on the basis that Logic, to be metaphysical, must base its movement on the *content* of thoughts, not just their forms.
How do we get beyond the form to the content? If we understand a definition, we merely understand the form.
It's by holding it in our mind that we can come to the content.

This is not intuition-ism, because one does not uncritically accept the result uncritically, but explicates it again in formalized thought and checks it logically</p>

Im not sure I have it backwards, maybe I worded it wrong or maybe we don't agree what is the final point of the sublation. I think Determinate Being is the final point of the sublation not Becoming, Becoming is only partially sublated. Becoming is mediated but Determinate Being is immediate as Hegel says in the quote I made above:-

“From becoming there issues determinate being, which is the simple oneness of being and nothing. Because of this oneness it has the form of immediacy. Its mediation, becoming, lies behind it; it has sublated itself and determinate being appears, therefore, as a first, as a starting-point for the ensuing development.”</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "the mind makes general images of objects, long before it makes notions of them"

The key word here being long before, which does not necessarily mean immediate. But I actually feel like we are getting further away from our disagreement, because I don't necessarily disagree with this:

"What Hegel does is different in that he uses language to construct a mental image or intuition and then clarifies it bit by bit with the Remarks and the rest of the text. These are ways of developing a Notion (admittedly not entirely clear what that means), which is beyond language and at best conveyed, not defined, by it."

But it is by no means a difference from mathematics, at all! In fact, since you mentioned formalism, your explanation might as well be one of intuitionism, which holds that all mathematics is based in intuition which is geometric in nature and which is only conveyed through mathematical symbolism (it goes a bit deeper than that, in fact it's interesting to go back to what Brouwer actually thought, who was actually deeply engaged in mysticism (compare Hegel (Enc§82d):</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "It should also be mentioned here that the meaning of the speculative is to be understood as being the same as what used in earlier times to be called “mystical”, especially with regard to the religious consciousness and its content. When we speak of the “mystical” nowadays, it is taken as a rule to be synonymous with what is mysterious and incomprehensible; and, depending on the ways their culture and mentality vary in other respects, some people treat the mysterious and in­comprehensible as what is authentic and genuine, whilst others regard it as belong­ing to the domain of superstition and deception. About this we must remark first that “the mystical” is certainly something mysterious, but only for the understand­ing, and then only because abstract identity is the principle of the understanding. But when it is regarded as synonymous with the speculative, the mystical is the concrete unity of just those determinations that count as true for the understanding only in their separation and opposition. So if those who recognise the mystical as what is genuine say that it is something utterly mysterious, and just leave it at that, they are only declaring that for them, too, thinking has only the Significance of an abstract positing of identity, and that in order to attain the truth we must renounce thinking, or, as they frequently put it, that we must “take reason captive.” As we have seen, however, the abstract thinking of the understanding is so far from being something firm and ultimate that it proves itself, on the contrary, to be a constant sublating of itself and an overturning into its opposite, whereas the rational as such is rational precisely because it contains both of the opposites as ideal moments within itself. Thus, everything rational can equally be called “mystical”; but this only amounts to saying that it transcends the understanding. It does not at all imply that what is so spoken of must be considered inaccessible to thinking and incomprehensible."</p>

Brouwer might have thought that all formalism only consists of instructions to reconstruct an inner truth but that doesn't mean he abstained from using it! So why souldn't we apply the same to Hegel?</p>

I don't think that's true.

"Every time I re-read a previous part of the book having read further, I understand that part much more clearly. I may have understood it formally or literally the first time, but I didn't understand the content of the thought."

Again, mathematics evolves constantly, but its prior truths remain unchanged, only recontextualized, similar to re-reading a book.

"Hegel definitely does criticize formalism. He does so precisely on the basis that Logic, to be metaphysical, must base its movement on the content of thoughts, not just their forms."

Yes, he applies logic to logic, as had stressed from my first participation in the reading group.

"How do we get beyond the form to the content? If we understand a definition, we merely understand the form.
It's by holding it in our mind that we can come to the content."

If all you understand about a definition are that words are written on a page, you haven't understood the definition at all. Again, that's no real difference.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I truly hate when people act like mathematics is understanding some manipulation rules and applying them to sentences in order to derive other sentences. It's such a cliche! And I get that people have no idea about mathematics because they've never been exposed to it, but still, not even Hilbert believed that. The life and blood of mathematics consists of understanding the essence of definitions as conveyed through symbols and using that understanding to make explicit what is already clear.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> I'm not so willing as Andru to discredit Maths here, I know hardly anything about Theoretical Maths. I see the whole process of Logic so far as kind of going back and forth between formalism, or understanding, on the one hand and speculation/Reason on the other. Also the whole development of Maths is surely dialectical as well like anything else, not the formal method of Maths obviously but the history and metaphysics of Maths perhaps, for want of a better phrase.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> I distinctly try not to do that. In fact I'm constantly highlighting what that we not do that. Furthermore, if asked, I could already count down a litany of instances where I don't think what is written completely aligns with the interpretations given by Lawvere and/or Schreiber. I don't, because nobody except me knows those interpretations, but it's not like I simply overlay them on top of what is written. In fact, when other people give premature identifications, like that of oppositions with contradictions or of contradiction with everything, I go out of my way to correct that. With that said, there are clear instances where what Hegel writes just obviously corresponds to mathematical notions, which I'm not going to forfeit just because I don't want to distort the text. And that's not even about Lawvere's interpretation, it's about basic concepts that come up all the time. Like in the section about the boundary, it was just obvious to me what he was talking about because it corresponded to stuff I am literally doing research on. It is just obviously in the text, which I'm honestly surprised about. I'm not going to pretend it's not there when Hegel is literally making arguments about Newton's treatment of differentiation!</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> No, that's actually fairly fitting:

" §174 The foregoing dialectic is the same, too, as that which understanding employs the notion of infinitesimal magnitudes, given by higher analysis. A more detailed treatment of this notion will be given later. These magnitudes have been defined as such that they are in their vanishing, not before their vanishing, for then they are finite magnitudes, or after their vanishing, for then they are nothing."

But check out the first annotation of "The infinity of the Quantum", that's where he really gets into it!</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Is it? I don't think I mentioned anything math related for instance in my summary on the last chapter. With that said, math is metaphysical, and lots of what he talks about are logical or mathematical notions: contradiction, finitude, infinity, boundary, das eins, all of these are mathematical in nature. And it shouldn't be surprising, really, that mathematics would heavily feature in a metaphysical text.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> I guess part of why I do that is to keep the mathematical notions clean. I actually hate it when people make haphazard connections, like between, say, set theory and the French revolution, because it diminishes both of those concepts. But Hegel brings in these concepts like contradiction on his own, and this was exactly what the analytics charged him with: using unclear concepts, like continuity (Russell) to introduce metaphysical muddles and hide formal incoherence. But then you have Lawvere, who made real, current-day mathematics out of it (which is more than can be said about analytic philosophy). So part of why I started to actually read it was to see for myself if there is substance to it, if Hegel is a charlatan or a genius, or if he couldn't handle the ghosts he summoned. And there clearly is, even if I'm not sure I'd go with everything he wrote! And that makes me happy. I actually feel joy when reading the book, just to see how what he does and where he goes with it. It is so unforseeable, he always throws a curveball at you! So I do want to convey what I can see he does (and when I can see it because sometimes I'm really not sure how he gets from one thing to the other). But I don't want to diminish anyone else's enjoyment. So I'll try to keep everything approachable, it is actually usually in the negative, when I'm explaining why someone else's formalization falls short, that I actually get into the technicalities.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> Do you agree with what you quoted, particularly:

"As we have seen, however, the abstract thinking of the understanding is so far from being something firm and ultimate that it proves itself, on the contrary, to be a constant sublating of itself and an overturning into its opposite, whereas the rational as such is rational precisely because it contains both of the opposites as ideal moments within itself. Thus, everything rational can equally be called “mystical”; but this only amounts to saying that it transcends the understanding"</p>

"Any formal truth, taken too far becomes untruth; that's where you come to the negation of it."

Maybe I am conflating formalism and the understanding too much, although I believe Hegel see's their connection as well.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I am not implying math is "manipulation rules and applying them to sentences in order to derive other sentences".
Not at all.
But I do not think that their content can be regarded as metaphysical. 
Hegel uses some concepts from math, as logic always has, but there are important differences, especially with finite and infinite. The chapter on Quantity definitely is full of maths, again, I think it needs to be taken in its metaphysical significance, as grounding mathematical concepts from outside.

The outside-of-math-ness of metaphysics which I refer to is capture in the meaning of Being, and why its formalization looses its point. I already explained a great deal about that without a response to I'll stop for now.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I think see what you're saying. This is something I was having trouble with. I could see that the Understanding relates to the moment of Being and Reason to the moment of Becoming but wasn't sure whether the moment of Nothing was related to Understanding or Reason. To me it seems he's saying that the move to nothing is still within the realm of the understanding. Like you say, taken to its logical end point it becomes its opposite.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "Being is the notion implicit only: its special forms have the predicate ‘is’; when they are distinguished they are each of them an ‘other’: and the shape which dialectic takes in them, i.e. their further specialisation, is passing over into another. This further determination, or specialisation, is at once a forth-putting and in that way a disengaging of the notion implicit in being; and at the same time the withdrawing of being inwards, its sinking deeper into itself. Thus the explication of the notion in the sphere of being does two things: it brings out the totality of being, and it *abolishes the immediacy of being, or the form of being as such.*"</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Yeah I've got a feeling he may be wrong on that, I think he takes Dasein too literally as 'Being There'. This is Houlgate again 😄</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I mean, Heidegger is definiteing doing something very different than Hegel; I don't think you want to conflate the two uses of the term Dasein, but the former definitely didnt base his understanding on like a misreading of Hegel or soemethign</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Yea that's why I qualified my statment about "knowing being". We know it is there, but that "only" suggests that "Being as such" is not directly apprehend able. But we cannot doubt that "there is", i don't think. I think that's the Hegelian sublation of Descartes; but I'm checking that right now
That is why Nothing is particularly</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Heidegger's criticism of Hegel may be based on a misreading, but he's not like a confused Hegelian. He is definitely influence by Hegel, but he is trying to do his own thing</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The Notion is the principle of freedom, the power of substance self-realised. It is a systematic whole, in which each of its constituent functions is the very total which the notion is, and is put as indissolubly one with it. Thus in its self-identity it has original and complete determinateness.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I agree with the first part in the sense that thinking constantly evolves, and that a primary way in which it evolves is through restriction and therefore exclusion, which creates a parallel opportunity to study the excluded, which has been a pattern in thought for a long time, I don't think that this invalidates or changes prior results though, only places them into proper context. I am fascinated with the connection to the mystical and how it was in the background of so many great scientists, and I'm definitely willing to go with Hegel in the weaker sense of, basically, intuition, but as to his actual method, which he is hinting at, I think it's interesting but I haven't completely made up my mind about it. There clearly is a logic to it, but it is precisely because it's not rigorously formalized that it has to be approached with caution, because it could err at any moment.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Well, but if it is held in conscious experience, isn't it experienced, which was what I said? Regardless, I don't see how that's the contention of our disagreement at all, which isn't about whether an image in the mind is immediate but on whether it is valuable to try to formalize Hegel</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I agree with this "precisely because it's not rigorously formalized that it has to be approached with caution"
although, I would I would perhaps say, humility instead of caution. But same idea i think.

What I was saying before about formalization following after; I think ideas like Being and Nothing escape formalization; I have been looking more at that website, but mostly just out of curiosity, I remain skeptical of it. 

More to the point, the truth has to actually be established independent of formalization if it has to be established *prior to it*, right?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I also definitely disagree with that. I don't think prior truths in philosophy change in a sense that isn't simple recontextualization. They might have been false from the beginning or concerned, say, social relations that changed over time, but insofar as we are talking about actual metaphysical truths, I don't think they change at all.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Again I'll underline that I'm not saying we should from the outset assume the existence of mathematics. What he's doing is deriving the existence of mathematics from a supposedly more basic metaphysical reasoning using the abstract unity and concrete difference of being and nothing in becoming as a basis. I've never disagreed with that. That's still metaphysical though as it is literally beyond the physical. In other words, the laws of the physical universe could vary in a way that mathematical laws can't, which though still can vary in a way that logical laws can't, which can still vary though! And, and here is the fun part, this variation can be described using category, of course assuming a meta-framework within our normal thinking, but can still at least to a limited extent trace out the results of variations in logic! And this is actually done in current mathematical research! However, it does depend on a prior framework that is always implicitly assumed, but I still maintain that Hegel does that too, as he is again using at least human intuition, and, let's be honest, also logical laws before he has them derived.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> However, and that is actually what I consider a controversial thought of mine, I think geometry might vary less than logic. As in, we can vary logic but the  basic geometric shapes stay the same. But I'm not completely sure about that.</p>

I don't. I think their experience cannot be formalized, but the role they are playing in the overall system can.

"More to the point, the truth has to actually be established independent of formalization if it has to be established prior to it, right?"

I don't think so. I think it has to be *grasped* prior to it but is only fully established afterwards. In fact, you can even apply that directly to Hegel without any recourses to mathematics, as he is using notions he is only fully defining later.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Well, it has. On a very concrete level, one usually starts with a nice structure to then note the necessity of going outside that structure, to discover the initial structure is only one of a great many of such structures, but is particularly well-behaved, which makes it all the more special. You can make this a lot more abstract, and Hegel does, but that happened again and again in human history.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> So there is a lot going on here but to go back to the first bit after I spoke --- Contradictions are easy to define: its ∃ a (a and not a). 

He doesn't say that the contradiction of the finite is subjective in the paragraph I shared, he seems to distinguish them --- I think his point there seems to be that in the first appearance of nothing we have a subjective contradiction (i.e. we've thought something contradictory) whereas in the second contradiction it appears he's talking about the finite as a determinate object (which is a something because it contains something as one of its moments). I.e. an objective contradiction. 

The reason nothing, for me reading this, has constituent elements is because we are *diving into* these objects --- i.e. becoming is internal to nothing and determinate being is internal of becoming. So when we come to a further determination along in the process of the writing, the determination curls back and impacts every object that was previously discussed. So nothing *at the start* (before the elements 'are posited in it') doesn't have constituent elements --- sure, because nothing *at the start* is only observed from the outside and is the stupidest possible nothing, an incredibly boring object which gives us basically no understanding of what is going on. Its like a perfect sphere or point or symbolic token (i.e. merely the word nothing or as Hegel puts it 'not', negation). And Hegel warns us not to pause there in the introduction. The problem is that the moment you take that token seriously as an object and *really* have negation or not (really the moment you say that there is any kind of *actual* negation, not mere token '-' --- you are off to the races in terms of turning that not against itself because you can then go '--' and get a positive object, which you can name 'a' and you can negate that again into a negative object '-a' and that tells you ∃a (-a and a) --- i.e. you get a contradiction which lets everything else appear).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> "The idea of "reading" it a certain way is contrary to the very point of the book"

Actually, my point is that reading it in a Zizekian way is just reading it: i.e. there are defenses for what I am saying all throughout the book, I keep seeing them (for example at the very beginning Hegel mentions that the beginning is the end and that everything loops back on itself: so I'm saying 'hey, maybe Hegel is limited by form here, maybe, we gotta read the whole thing in a single splat to understand it, because to read it linearly is actually to misunderstand it, in part because the infinite --- which Hegel calls reason itself --- is a circle'). The fact that we like to yell at each other and that you don't want to read me charitably doesn't negate that.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "If there's any representation thought of contradiction, it seems like it would be the unity of opposites; the dialectic of opposition as not rigidly separate but also not identical, united and different. And in this unity, a becoming of a third.
The unity of Being and Nothing become existence; and similarly in repitition, we the Something and Other are united in Being-for-itself.
In the shorter logic, he says "Being-for-itself ... As the relation of the negative to itself it is a being that is for itself, the One"; he goes on to discuss it as "the One", "it does not relate as something does to other but instead, as the unity of something and an other".

This unity creates contradiction for the understanding because looking  at the opposition as such, their unity seems impossible. But their opposition is sublated in the unity, it's still there, but  not visible." 

I think the problem here might be the word 'impossible': contradictions are impossible but all of their effects are possible and as a result it is possible for a contradiction to be partially possible (i.e. for a part of the contradiction to be possible --- both in terms of either half without the other half but also in terms of a partial object which can adhere to either half but which is not bound to either half --- i.e. petit objet a which is the contradiction of contradiction: i.e. both a contradiction and not a contradiction, the part which 'exists' is not a contradiction and the fact that it can adhere to either possible state is the contradiction). 

This is the difficulty that I have is that the contradiction *is in the object itself* not just in the understanding of the object and the way to resolve it is to create petit objet a (which is precisely what happens in the move from becoming to determinate being: becoming is the grand movement of everything, determinate beings are always missing something, always partial, always without, always lacking: that's the point of quality).</p>

To use a spacial metaphor; I think the understanding is like a 2 dimensional snapshot, and dialectics is trying to understand things in 3 dimensions. So we see a couple 2-d images and see things which appear contradictory and have to Reason into the depth, the third dimension, to see how the contradiction is only apparent, ie resolves"

I half agree with this: my position is that if you reduce it to set theory you have to do so by speaking about the contradictions in set theory (such as Russell's paradox).</p>

I think you should rethink this: I don't think reason escapes formalism, rather reason is formalism taken to the end.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> So I would like to juxtapose the unity of opposites in the number line against another possibility: a mere amalgamation. I could give you all the numbers in the world as like [-124593.23452, 9384, 3.1467, 27...] like as a set without order and this, I think, is what hegel calls 'simple unity'. The reason the number-line begins to take on contradictory nature is precisely its orderedness: i.e. its possible to move smoothly from one side of point to the other and back again and have all that make sense (and this is a folding in of the contradiction into the object).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> Also, nothing does exist too: its just that this doesn't mean what people think it means... Because we are dealing with linear logic we cannot produce every outcome in every timeline and thus the specific contradictions, the specific 'nothing' matters. At least that is my reading...

However, I do think... that there was a conflation I was making which you were right to call me out on. When Hegel is speaking of simple unity he's speaking about simple amalgamation I think and there is a contradiction in it, it just isn't a contradiction of the objects concerned (i.e. the object form 'amalgamation' has a contradiction/boundary of its own between it and other concepts, but that doesn't mean the things in the list are in contradiction with each other until the amalgamation is developed into something that brings them into contact, like a number line which does contain a contradiction in the form of the possibilities of motion about a single point it implies).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> So I disagree with you about formalism but its for a different reason --- I think that all formalisms already contain their failure, their contradiction inside themselves (a fact which is constantly demonstrated within mathematics) and for that reason formalism already contains the failed object, you don't have to reach 'beyond' formalism to acquire immediacy (or to put it another way, there is already immediacy in formalism in the form of the token/symbol which always has an immediate embodiment in the formalism before it begins to signify anything). Immediacy exists imeddiately within formalism, immediacy is a moment of the mediated (contained within the mediated). That's why railing against formalism is not a useful or interesting project from my perspective (because the only reason to rail against it is to claim there is an outside to it, there is no outside).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> The problem with 'definitions' to my reading is that Spinoza isn't developing his results out of the immediacy of the formalism itself. I.e. when I give definitions really I'm making assumptions. Hegel is assuming something (the basic fact of formalism, which is negation) but its just the single thing, which is the single thing we need to be able to actually proceed with any thought anyway...</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I think there is a misreading here: specifically the idea seems to be that what is reaquired is for us to negate formalism in an undirected way. Any such negation will either just provide confusion or a different formalism (Alex is choosing 'different formalism' and Andru, I think are choosing confusion). Rather we need to do an 'x of x' and read this as we need to formalize formalism itself which is what Hegel is doing in the science of logic (i.e. notice that formalism itself is a contradictory negation --- becuause it is a determinate being and all determinate beings are contradictory negations of some other thing through their qualities). The formalization of formalism itself reduces down to a single token... negation (Hegel goes for 'being' but I continue to deeply suspect this, but the basic move of going for a single token/symbol is correct). 

I get your point that he's not defining it in chapter 1 but he is developing it throughout the whole book (i.e. he's constantly applying the negatory token back onto itself at every step and aquiring a new token 'nothing is the being of being' --- 'becoming is the nothing of nothing' --- 'determinate being is the becoming of becoming' --- 'quality is the determinate being of determinate being' --- 'something is the quality of quality' etc. He doesn't state these moves in exactly these terms, but that's how I read what he's doing) and each of these moves is purely formal starting from a purely formal base: i.e the 'philosophical' move he's taking here is to reject formalism through its total embrace (i.e. embrace it to the point of contradiction). However, I think he's actually both defining and developing because both have to be done due to the nature of the object defined (i.e. due to the nature of quality as a necessary moment of being). That's the difficulty that I'm having with this yelling about formalism: the immediate doesn't lie beyond the formal but rather is its internal contradiction.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Also, I think you shoud consider that Hegel... doesn't know what he's talking about here in modern terms. Symbolic logic didn't even exist when Hegel is writing (and there is a lot of this section on infinity which is annoying to read as a modern mathematician because its like 10 lines of code to describe what he wants but he has to repeat himself 50 different ways because he doesn't have the words for it). Like here he's still stuck on the infinite as a circle, he doesn't even know (likely) that there are more than one order of infinity --- aleph null vs aleph 1 (though he'd probably think that's an interesting result and he certainly is approaching that point and failing over and over again).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> I would be careful with this one... I think Hegel thinks there is an infinite (and the infinite is reason... i.e. the necessary exclusion of contradiction which also necessitates the near existence of contradiction). I would say that what Hegel is stumbling over but not really expressing well, I think, is self-similarity (i.e. he would look at a Mandelbrot set and say 'there, there is the infinite').</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Hegel does both, he defines *and* develops --- the development occurs as a necessary moment of the definition. The starting point is sufficient to entail the whole logic (i.e. the definition is 'complete') but that starting point is a self-contradictory token s.t. the development is required because there are many possible missteps where one-sidedness might cause one to fail to take necessary steps because they are only necessary in abstract at the highest level, across the whole logic, not in a particular reality (and we exist in particular realities --- and this failure is like the fifth step in... its just after quality where he points out that realities are determinate beings).</p>

However, I don't let that flipped value discount the rest of his arguments for me.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Also I should address this because its been bothering me: I think that when I say 'I'm doing a Zizekian reading of Hegel' People might think I'm like a grad student whose advisor really loves Foucault and I really like St. Thomas Aquinis and so I go to my advisor and say 'My thesis is a Foucaultian reading of Aquinis' --- as if the world ever needed such a thing. What I'm actually saying is that I think that the reader Hegel himself wants (or rather the spirit of Hegel if we like: i.e. where the understanding of Hegel is) in the modern world today, is Zizek. This isn't a postmodernist pastiche I'm doing here.</p>

It's more like a very dogmatic protestant Sect distorting the Bible to fit their own weird sectarian dogma and claiming it confirms what they already believed.
And not offering any substantive arguments, but just dismissing what other people have to say.

When you say you are reading this such is "because we are *diving into* these objects"

There is literally no textual evidence that Hegel suggests this and it seems to be like a very arbitrary misunderstanding you have clinged very strongly, I don't know why.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> It's amusing that you say I'm choosing confusion:
It's actually important to let yourself feel confused if you ever want to learn anything.

Confusion is how your mind recognizes that you don't understand. You have to sit with that in order to  understand something as difficult as Hegels text.

If you run away or suppress your confusion, you'll end up w a lot of false confidence that you "already know things" but aren't actually so.

I think I actually understand the first part of the text quite well and am clear in my explanations.
So I'm not sure what you think I'm confused about.
Moving beyond formalism is not a sea of confusion.
It's Thinking in thoughts rather than definitions.

Formalization is helpful to be precise in our thinking and to hold out thinking outside of us so we can check it.

This "checking" is precisely what is done by Hegel with his method of making the thoughts the Object of immediate awareness. (Alex, I don't know why you persistent in claiming concepts cannot be immediate; can you explain why you claim this?)

Formalism is a check on knowledge. But it requires reducing thoughts to other thoughts. This cannot be done for basic premises, as we have all agreed.
So if formalization is "necessary" for truth, but the premises cannot be formalized, and as we all agree, formalism only provides truth on the bases of its premises, than formalism proves the impossibility of truth.

It's simply absurd to say "there is no truth without formalism". Formalism depends on premises, truths outside itself.

Something 'true' outside formalism is always needed to establish the truth of formalism. Formalism itself cannot acquire truth.

This is why a method for checking ones thoughts *other* than formalism is necessary.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> If formalism is a way of representing thoughts mediated by simpler thought, than we need a different way of representing thoughts for the simplest thoughts.

That is in our own mind. The method described w quotes.

We can discuss it's validity or pitfalls. But Hegel is definitely not in "total embrace" of formalism, unless you mean it in a very weird sense, more like Platonic forms than what we are talking about.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> If that is what Alex said, that concepts cannot be immediate thats easy to falsify by looking at the first few lines of Determinate Being as such:

§ 191
"From becoming there issues determinate being, which is the simple oneness of being and nothing. Because of this oneness it has the form of immediacy."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Regards both "form" and the immediacy of thought/concepts: I found this quote address the confusion. Regards Alex's claim that Hegel presupposes/assumes "human intuition" and "logical laws before he has them derived".

Here is Hegel's explanation of what he is doing:

"Logic is usually said to be concerned with forms only and to derive the material for them from elsewhere. But this ‘only’, which assumes that the logical thoughts are nothing in comparison with the rest of the contents, is not the word to use about *forms which are the absolutely real ground of everything*. Everything else rather is an ‘only’ compared with these thoughts. To make such abstract forms a problem presupposes in the inquirer a higher level of culture than ordinary; and to study them in themselves and for their own sake signifies in addition that these thought-types *must be deduced out of thought itself*, and their truth or reality examined by the light of their own laws. We do not assume them as data from without, and then define them or exhibit their value and authority by comparing them with the shape they take in our minds. If we thus acted, we should proceed from observation and experience, and should, for instance, say we habitually employ the term ‘force’ in such a case, and such a meaning. A definition like that would be called correct, if it agreed with the conception of its object present in our ordinary state of mind. The defect of this empirical method is that a notion is not defined as it is in and for itself, but in terms of something assumed, which is then used as a criterion and standard of correctness. No such test need be applied: *we have merely to let the thought-forms follow the impulse of their own organic life.*"</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Here is the following sentences which are probably important:

"To ask if a category is true or not, must sound strange to the ordinary mind: for a category apparently becomes true only when it is applied to a given object, and apart from this application it would seem meaningless to inquire into the truth. But this is the very question on which every thing turns. We must however in the first place understand clearly what we mean by Truth. In common life truth means the agreement of an object with our conception of it. We thus presuppose an object to which our conception must conform. In the philosophical sense of the word, on the other hand, truth may be described, in general abstract terms, as the agreement of a thought-content with itself. "</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> So perhaps this criteria itself is presupposed and not proven. Maybe; but what I would like to insist is that before we can claim that, we have to read him carefully enough to see if he develops it anywhere. In my opinion, we have to learn how he gets from A to B, to ask whether he is smuggling in assumptions in the *how* he gets there. I am actually super interested in digging into enough to see if there is content which is not derived or justified. I have thought I have found them, and then kept reading and reflecting and only later realized it is justified</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> But "form" here is different than formalism of symbolic logic. And why it has to be primary; we are talking about the most basic possible structures of thought: Being and Nothing/Emptiness.

There are no thoughts without "is-ness" implicit in them; and for Hegel, negation is the basis of Reason, and negation is predicated on Nothing.

But the only way we can know if these are the "impulse of their own organic life" of the Thought of Being and Nothing, is to attempt to *think* them, to hold them in our mind and allow them move, and not bring in our preconcieved understandings about them.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I mean, do a ctrl-f on 'outside' of the chapter on determinate being:

section 222
"Being and nothing in their unity, which is determinate being are no longer being and nothing — these they are only *outside their unity* — thus in their unstable unity, in becoming, they are coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be."

(their unity here being the determinate being which is inside of these objects... i.e. you can't have determinate being not be inside of being, it isn't other from from being, so the unit is inside of the joint object of being-nothing, i.e. becoming). 

Yes there is, when developing the logic of determinate being he literally says that the limitation is *inside* of the object, that being-for-other is *inside* of the object, (there's this whole paragraph where he talks about how the normal parlance treats these things as 'outside' and that's fine and all, but it isn't the direction he's going with it --- section 244:

"Now in so far as something in its limit both is and is not, and these moments are an immediate, qualitative difference, the negative determinate being and the determinate being of the something fall outside each other. Something has its determinate being outside (or, as it is also put, on the inside) of its limit; similarly, the other, too, because it is a something, is outside it. Limit is the middle between the two of them in which they cease. They have their determinate being beyond each other and beyond their limit; the limit as the non-being of each is the other of both."

i.e. the actual being of the object lies outside the limit (or as it is also put 'inside' --- here hegel is saying that the whole orientation of common parlance around 'limit' is incorrect, but he'll repeat it to make it clear what he means: he means that we are talking about the stuff 'inside' the limit at a spatial level and 'outside' the limit conceptually).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> Read your own quote carefully: How is Determinate being "inside" being *if* "in their unity ... [they] are no longer being and nothing"? 

How can x be in y, if y is *only* outside x?

He explicitly says in that passage right there, Being and Nothing *only* exist in Determinate being in their unity *as* "coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be".

You are right, "Det-begin it isn't other from from being"; Det being precedes the other; Neither Being nor Determinate Being are "somethings"; you seem to be treating them as "somethings" by suggesting they have insides and outsides.

Being is in Determinate as sublated; as a moment of both moments. This is why thinking about inside/outside, subset/superset are all WRONG.

It just is not like that. You have to let go of these ways of thinking and think about it in the way Hegel describes.

Being is in every single concept; if its meaningful, it has Being. Outside of Being: there isn't even nothing, because Nothing has being.

When he says "Pure Being" or "Being as such", He is talking about holding the *thought of Being in your mind*; it passes into the *thought of Nothing* and back; the Being of Nothingness, to my mind, is the best way to understand Pure Being. 

These passings give the bases for new thoughts; coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be; these both contain Being and Nothing, but not *as such* but as sublated - as moments, but their "as such" has disappeared. 

Determinate Being then contains them in this same way; but it is neither  contained "inside" Being, nor vise versa; Being is inside Det Being, but not Being "as such". Being "as such" exists only outside of all determinateness.

We simply *must* think of these thoughts *as the thoughts they are*, not translated into any other system of thought. Their basicness requires this; thats the same reason formalization of them misses the point. They *have* to be grasped in their "immediacy", or in their "immanent meaning"</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Or, for example we start with the section on finitude like this:

"This contradiction is, indeed, abstractly present simply in the circumstance that the something is finite, or that the finite is. But something or being is no longer abstractly posited but reflected *into itself* and developed as *being-within-self* which possesses a determination and a constitution, and, still more specifically, a *limit* which, as *immanent in the something* and constituting the quality of its *being-within-self*, is finitude. It is to be seen what moment are contained in this Notion of the finite something."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Or there's this gem:

"This infinite, as the consummated return into self, the relation of itself to itself, is being-but not indeterminate, abstract being, for it is posited as negating the negation; it is, therefore, also determinate being for it contains negation in general and hence determinateness. It is and is there, present before us. It is only the spurious infinite which is the beyond, because it is only the negation of the finite posited as real — as such it is the abstract, first negation; determined only as negative, the affirmation of determinate being is lacking in it; the spurious infinite, held fast as only negative, is even supposed to be not there, is supposed to be unattainable. However, to be thus unattainable is not its grandeur but its defect, which is at bottom the result of holding fast to the finite as such as a merely affirmative being. It is what is untrue that is unattainable, and such an infinite must be seen as a falsity. The image of the progress to infinity is the straight line, at the two limits of which alone the infinite is, and always only is where the line — which is determinate being — is not, and which goes out beyond to this negation of its determinate being, that is, to the indeterminate; the image of true infinity, bent back into itself, becomes the circle, the line which has reached itself, which is closed and wholly present, without beginning and end."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Sorry, I haven't agreed that thoughts can't be reduced to other thoughts for basic premises. 

Formalism can acquire truth --- it can aquire the truth of formalism itself (i.e. it is immediate to itself, i.e. that is the science of logic, that's the whole point of the introduction as I read it).

I think the term 'simpler' here is the problem for the simplest thoughts they are their own 'simpler' thoughts (i.e. once we get down to the level of contradiction it represets itself as a pure token).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I think there is an assumption here (on your part) that formalism entails assumption beyond the object of the formal itself and I think that needs to be disentangled: What I read Hegel saying here is not that we need to reach beyond formalism but rather that we need to turn formalism against itself at its base (i.e. for me the more interesting line is *their truth or reality examined by the light of their own laws* --- i.e. we need to peer into them or the end is also important *we have merely to let the thought-forms follow the impulse of their own organic life* --- i.e. peer into them).</p>

But Alex and I were disagreeing about the value in formalizing the thoughts of Being and Nothing in symbolic logic of Category theory.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> No you cannot use the quotes of "peering into them" to say that the movement of the logic is doing that.

Every single moment requires the individual thought to be "peered into" in its Immediacy to establish its Truth before moving on.
It's not that the movement of the Logic is peering more and more "into" or "inside"
The language of "in" and "into" are not the same as "inside".

The Doctrine of Essence discusses outer appearance versus inner essence. Even here, its more of a linguistic thing than insideness as spacial; at least usually. Sometimes it happens to be spacially inside.
But even in our current chapter, limit and inside are *not* spacial.

All that visual imagery can be helpful to develop the thoughts, but we ultimately have to let it go and understand these thoughts as "pure abstraction", as thoughts simply as they are derived</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Sorry read the text even more closely --- he's saying that there is a thing which is being and nothing and when we're looking at the portion of the thing that is outside of determinate being that is when its this 'pure nothing' and 'pure being' but when we consider the unified portion of this thing we get determinate being. Its like how I'm Mr. Jones if I meet a cop, Dr. Jones if I'm at a conference, Thomas to my friends, and Tom to people who don't know me very well in professional settings. Its a naming convention over a partial object. I.e. now that the contradiction of being and nothing has moved into determinate being it isn't a pure abstract contradiction but becomes filled in with specificity.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> But my point is that this what they are 'as such' --- being is a contradiction of somethings 'as such' in its own essence *because* determinate being is a necessary consequence of it --- to say otherwise is to say that determinate being is not a consequence, its to move from being-nothing-becoming to determinate being in a metaphysical manner.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> If you think about the "What Is", ie of everthing - actual and potential and otherwise. "What Is" is Da-Sein, Det Being. The "what" of "what is" is distinct for the "is". 
Normal science / physics / empirical science pays attention to the "what" to the loss of the "is". Being is not a container of "what is", but the is-ness of it</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Yeah, I know that they aren't spatial (in a materialist way) I'm saying that they are conceptually inside, that the further developments are necessary from the previous ones (i.e. that there is an if-then relation). We aren't going 'outside' because we aren't just assuming determinate being into existence, the claim is that its a necessary development that results from being. If you start saying 'oh well this next thing is outside this previous thing' then to me that means 'oh this next thing is something extra from this previous thing, not a necessary development from it but just some crap I pulled out of my ass'.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Yeah, I mean something formal by 'inside' and 'outside' and I use those words advisedly because I think that this is what people tend to think when we say something is 'outside' or 'building': they tend to think that they are doing actual work with the development of determinate being and such wheras the point is that, no, that is all just a necessary consequence. Its work for us as thinkers (because the consequence is not always immediately visible in the consequent) but it is internal to the consequent, a part of it that you can't just chop off.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> I understand better what you mean: the movment is immanent and logically necessary, from the "peering into", the thoughts, we see their truth, and the movement is a result of their truth. 

What I have been reacting to is the "container" language, set-theoretical or otherwise.

I also agree absolutely "its work for us as thinkers"; and not external from our conscious thought; the goal is to clear ones mind sufficiently that the thoughts themselves determine their own movment, not that they are moved by our mind.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Are you saying that there is no being in determinate being? that seems like a crazy position (i.e. that being doesn't apply to determinate being). 

Ah, I think I see now... when I say 'x is not y' you are still treating this as if y is exactly equal to the territory that perfectly excludes x. How about this line: the state of Washington is not the United States. I.e. having being as a negative moment of determinate being doesn't say anything about its containment. Or to put even better --- the mind is not the brain (even though in some sense they perfectly overlap).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I think hegel has if-then but maybe he only has the syllogisms which are partial if-thens? But yeah we're dealing with necessity here, in my reading which I take to be an aspect of contradiction (i.e. contradiction already has consequence itself as its consequence).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> Being is also not *just* the capacity for any word. 
We can think things which we have no words for. 

Being also is beyond thought and language. Thought is; Pre-human history *is*, even *is* actual in a past tense: *was* actual.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Yeah, but Andru's point is precisely that these are not to be taken as concepts but as immediate experience for which instructions are conveyed through text. The question is about the justification of "being is" because "is" already contains being. But is is a concept. You can't ground immediate experience on a concept.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I am not claiming they are *not concepts*. But their concept is derived not from other concepts, only a description of a mental state taken to be the referent of the concept.

Even concepts grounded in other concepts can be held *immediately* in ones mind. You have an *experience* of various concepts in your mind when you do your logic research</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> What i mean here is that if I say 'if a then b' yes the typical reading is that a implies b, i.e. the truth of a garuntees the truth of b. But reverse this and the other way of writing it is '-b -> -a'. And the problem is that things like 'quality' 'determination', etc... these are all negations, so what that means is that their negatory aspect back propagates into a through the necessesity.</p>

The movements are of Being, Nothing, Becoming, Negation, Determination. They are different logical operators than If-Then</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I thought his definition made sense: being, pure being, as in, something defined and with no other qualities except that it exists, without a particular spatial extension or the like and also without an internal speration, which would be a distinction that is no longer pure being. The thought of this isn't particularly strange to me because I know such a structure from homotopy type theory, wherein it can also be described as the result of, basically, collapsing or suspending any particular structure by making all of its parts equal to itself, which is why it also made sense that he would say it is simple equality with itself. This goes into how a better treatment of equality can be as a structure instead of a property, an equality between two things or even of a thing to itself either existing or not instead of two things either being equal or not. This goes into how equality also can be not simple. I've seen all of this before, so it makes a lot of sense to me to see it again. Now, as to whether we can experience pure being, we clearly can experience our existence, but that is much more specific, but does the notion or image or even complex of images I hold in my mind count as experience even if it is fairly precise and detailed? Or is it better approached through meditation, which would be in some ways more immediate and is also something Hegel mentions as an approach? It really depends on what you count as experience.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I suppose the sense is that through meditation particularities of our consciousness can be stripped away, even to the point that spatial and temporal thinking as well as any other particularities are suspended</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I agree that stripping away is necessary. Otherwise it would be something, would be spatial or temporal, etc.
That's why I have compared it (clumsily) to Meditation. He does discuss "empty consciousness".
And in a sense, its mediated by the process to get to it. But *logically* it depends on no other thoughts or concepts</p>

My difficulty is that I think of immediate as being literally im-mediate --- i.e. a double mediation (double negation since mediation is a negation and immediate is the negation of negation).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> Nothing is the initial object/the empty set, containing nothing and being contained in everything in a precise mathematical sense. Now, the interesting thing is that for any particular background (mathematical) universe, every object is between the being and nothing of that universe, and in this precise sense these notions are even more basic than that of any other objects, which are between the two. But, for any particular universe we can step outside of it and treat the objects of this universe as in turn induced through structure outside of that universe. I'm using the term universe illustratively here, but it has a precise meaning, and one of its fundamental features is that every such universe is contained within another generalized universe, and in this background universe every object of the initial universe is an instantiation of being, basically, and thus abstractly the same thing, namely being. So being and nothing in our initial universe are both instantiations of being in our background universe and thus abstractly the same thing, though their role in the concrete initial universe is precisely opposing. I'm explaining a lot of theory fairly roughly here, so I'm sorry if it sounds a little confusing.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> One can also say that "every such universe generates another generalized universe out of it that then contains it". Both perspectives can be used as a starting point</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Category theory arises precisely when we zoom out of particular structures and instead look at their relations. But these relations in turn form a structure themselves, and structures of this kind can be compared between each other, forming a higher network of relations and therefore a structure, and so on… but, interestingly, this process has a limit: the ∞-category of ∞-categories, which contains itself, up to size issues that stem from Russell's paradox (therefore, strictly speaking, it doesn't exist, what exists is a "tower" of ∞-categories of "small" ∞-categories that never ends. I know you'll love this).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> No, I'm saying it's the most "mediated" thing, at least in the sense that it considers and is composed of all relations between everything in a giant and extremely complex network, basically. Not at all like pure being though, which has no further structure. This has lots of very complex structure.</p>

All I get when I try to think of Being is something that is, but I don't think thats pure Being so I try to think of whats even more fundamental than what 'is' and theres nothing, I fail to think pure Being so I just end up with Nothing.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The most mediated thing is contradiction-nothing --- though I think here I'm thinking new thoughts. I'm not completely certain on this question of mediation and immediate objects: it feels correct to me to say that contradiction is simultaneously the most mediated thing (because it's not every other thing) and also its totally immediate/immediacy itself (both at the level of thought---om, of, om, but also because I think contradictions are the sort of hard nodal points of non-exisrence that structure everything else: what we also call 'material').</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I don't know if this is 100% what he's saying, but it seems to me hes saying you learn it through the way the book is writen at first, with the arbitrary chapters and its forward motion.

He also seems to be saying tho that you learn Logic as a self contained subject that seems to have no consequence outside of itself but then armed with that knowledge as you practice in the more concrete sciences you start to see where it applys more clearly, so I could have got it muddled</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I don't think I'm jumping ahead in this precise sense --- Andru and I were talking about contra-position and he said that its later on so we don't have access to it but my problem is that I don't think you can really understand this by working forward from the beginning but instead have to understand it as a splat (i.e. every bit informs every other bit) and so if there is contra-position at any point in the book (and there is) it immediately caused backward flow of negative causality where the things at the front of the book take on the determinations of things later in the book through their status as consequent to these other things. 

No but its one of those things where I've read every other thing and so nothing he's saying is super shocking...</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Even if the form forces you to read it linearly, I think that there is a lot of trying to make a virtue of a necessary vice going on and on my side the frustration lies with the fact that everyone wants to live in the vice of having to read it linearly wheras I'm like --- no, Hegel is telling us over and over that this is a loopy type thing and you have to understand it that way.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0@firedog235#0</span> I'm curious what you mean "I've read every other thing"?

Also, I don't think the contrapositive will apply retro-acticely back on these chapters because their logical structure is Not syllogistic.
I could be wrong about that; truly. He describes things syllogistically sometimes; idk how contrapositive quite works with them.

But all his movements, every single one of them is a Negation already. By my understanding; even the Becoming of Existence is the negation of indeterminacy. What becomes? Just the negation of the *form* of Being prior.

This is why I think really understanding Being and Nothing is so important, however slippery.
They really are the bases for the logical movements from there.

With any of these moments, we think about: what it *is* - our understanding.
Move from it by negation to it's opposite, but a new opposite, ie Existence -> Quality -> Something.

All these movements are concretizing by negation.
Which is to say, contra <@589918821729566721> , I don't think any of this is arbitrary at all. The terms might be, but the thoughts they signify are not.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The beginning is even logically grounded:

His whole purpose it to get from "pure thought" which is the basis of Being/Nothing, pure in the sense of Immediacy and not needing any other thoughts to know them.
We can know is -ness, I think, from *our is -ness, our being*, as long as you separate it from the all the determinate content of your being.

Pure Knowing is the conceptual basis to know the truth of something.
My understanding is basically he is working towards a rigorous concept of Truth. Not a concrete truth, but the truth of 'what truth is', the immanent being of Truth.

In this sense, we cannot necessarily know if we have the ideas of Being, nothing, becoming, etc. *in their truth* until we know *how to know the truth of any thought/object*.
Which is the whole point of the book. And why it circles back.
I don't think that makes it *logically* circular, but it might.
We will have to see as we go.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> If determinate being is to be taken as a consequence of being, then whether or not Hegel knew he was doing a syllogism, he was doing a syllogism (however I think that he did know and they are meant to follow as syllogisms: he keeps saying, 'this is not yet posited in this' 'now this is posited by that' which all mean that a syllogism is being followed). 

However the contrapositive is perfectly happy working through a -> -b ::: b -> -a and we have to remember that if we want positive b, we can just grab it as the next sublation (i.e. if quality is negative, something will be the positive of quality, if something is negative, its limit will be positive, etc.) . When you pair this with the fact that we fall through a contradiction just about every other step (becoming, the finite, the infinite, etc.) then -a also flips back and forth in its meanings as well (i.e. being is its own opposite in becoming, limit is ought and ought is limit in the finite, the finite is the infinite and the infinite is the finite in 'the one,' etc). 

I agree it isn't arbitrary: but it isn't just negation --- its concretizing through contradiction-resolution. 

My point is that 'is'-ness if it is to be immediate it is so only because it is the most mediated thing ever (this is my materialism speaking here: even if we meditate on this stuff that is only possible through the movement of history to make us capable of such meditation). I don't think immediate is prior to mediation, but rather the turning back of mediation against itself (its the self contradiction of mediation)

You asked about a and -a being more or less simple than contradiction. The 'is' is not more simple but the '-' is the most simple thing of all: its immediacy itself --- however, it is also the most mediated object since it is also negation itself... I don't think it can be defined in any terms but itself, however it is also totally defined by itself (totally mediates itself because its totally mediated by 'everything').</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Every other thing means being around in Marxist spaces for 10 years, reading pieces of Hegel here and there, reading Zizek, my training as a computer science (which has a large dose of logic in it), reading Kant in school, Reading the grundrisse and other texts from Marx, Reading Mao, etc. Like just reading a lot of philosphically and political-economically oriented stuff which all has encounters with Hegel but isn't Hegel (except of course the pieces of Hegel which is Hegel). And my point isn't that these are all 'correct' but you encounter a lot of the arguments.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235.#0</span> I'd like a citation for that Hegel quote. Regardless, you should know that there are several kinds of infinity, and not just ℵ-s (which also don't return to their beginning). The inifiny in question here is basically infinite-dimensionality. And there is some truth to the idea that these structures are similar: they are similar in that a higher one contains the lower one (and not just as an object but also as a subset, to describe it in a set-theoretic analogy).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> So this one is half a new thought --- Hegel keeps mentioning 'self-relation' when talking about infinity and further on he definitely mentions non-relation (on the chapter on the one where he brings in the void) but I think that what he means by this 'self' relation is fractal self-similarity.... i.e. the infinite as a Mandelbrot set. I'm not saying that he's saying that explicitly (i.e. these things are not officially described until the 1960s) but I think he's stumbling around this concept in the section on infinity and he keeps talking about the line of infinite progress but this is just to make the infinite finite and so its spurious and how we also have to make finite infinite and so I'm like 'what does it mean to make the finite infinite' and to me that's fractal self similarity). 

ℵ-0 returns in that everything in it is a number, we can rebase anywhere we want (we can make any number zero when we reframe), We usually base the list of numbers themselves off a finite program or set of assumptions, etc. etc. (and this is the infinite finite I'm talking about: if there is any kind of relation, including non-relation --- which is a relation turned against itself --- then we are able to make the infinite finite and the finite infinite).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Two points:
Re: it's not just negation: 
My understanding of contradiction-resolution is negation of negation.
Every movement seems to involved discussing a lack in the previous moment; Quality is folded back into existence even, meaning Being is being becoming concrete.
Only with Something is it *a* being, an existent proper. And that is also the first Negation of the Negation, he says.

I'm trying to re-read the chapter slowly & carefully having profitted a lot from discussing the immanent connection of the forms and the movements.
Trying to comb out the structure of the movements.

I still don't think they are syllogistic.
Also: positing comes from the realm of essence, he notes this somewhere and it's explicit in that book.
Syllogism comes from the book on concept: only after Universal, particular, singular, which syllogisms depend on.
Syllogism is one version of if-then structure; it seems like you mean it in a more modern, broader if-then structure.

If you says that consequences implies such a structure; doesn't that assume a specific *type* of consequentiality?
Is it possible that if-then is one form but there could be others?

Are you suggesting that thought requires the structure you have in mind? Or perhaps you're projecting how you think onto it? 
Maybe there's a good argument for what you are suggesting; but I do not feel convinced</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> You can actually explain this a lot easier: infinity, as in, say, the infinite numbers from ℵ_0 onwards, arises at the limit of the finite, just in the classical way in which a limit sequence works, or the axiom of infinity, therefore is defined by the finite and furthermore is bounded by the finite, as in, if you imagine the infinite numbers as an interval, then it is half-closed with ℵ_0 its boundary. Therefore it is not truly infinite, (note that the German word "unendlich" literally means without end or boundary) as it has an end. Similarly, the finite numbers are only defined as finite by not being infinite, and furthermore, tend towards infinity. Therefore, both of these notions are intertwined and one goes into the other through negation, meaning complementation: the complement of the infinite numbers are the finite ones and the other way around. Hegel now says that this going into each other should be understood sequentially and forms "true infinity" as infinity going into finitude and then back into infinity infinitely often. I'll write it up more closely if I have the time.</p>

I can get a reference in a bit if you want.

In The passage I read closely on the infinite within the finite, the argument goes like this:
That finitude is *internally* determined to be finite; that it is intrinsic to finitude to be finite. Therefore, the finitude of finitude is not contingent on any*external* determinations. Therefore, nothing outside of it can lead it to cease-to-be. Finitude is the intrinsic nature towards ceasing-to-be (established in the prior section).
By self-determining this ceasing-to-be, finitude will *always* contain this end. It's this "always", which Hegel takes as it's infinity; infinity as eternality.
Eternality in classical philosophy (Engles gets this wrong in Anti-Duhring), is not persistent through time, but established outside of time.
Of course Hegel doesn't mean anything temporal in the context. Eternal means outside of the changes within movement of Logic.
Because it's self-determining, no other movements can change the nature of the finitude to be finite.
But this self-determining means that finitude never "ceases to be" finite.
And therefore this aspect of it is infinite.

I know it's weird because finitude is thought as a quality of a something; but here it's both the quality and the something. The question is finitude as a concept itself finite?
And it's the weird Hegelian way of thinking that forces the answer to be "yes! It must be, immanently!"
That's immanence is based in Hegels method of finding the content in the form, and the truth of the content, and re-establishing our understanding of the form based on this immanent truth.

Idk if I'm making sense; I honestly am not quite sure why the concept of finitude would have to be finite.
He concludes it doesn't, and that seems right</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235.#0</span> I'm also coming to be more sympathetic to both ideas of contra-position and mediation of immediacy.

The more he establishes about Existence in chapter two, the more we know what Pure Being is Not.
He said "something is, and therefore also is an existent".
So Is-ness is actually Existence (being, but determinate being).
I am thinking the best way to approach the two primordials is: Nothing is that which has Being but not Existence, is not something. 

But this approach is mediated. It's basically the contra-position which Thomas was talking about; back propagating negation. Or maybe I'm stretching that too much.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> This infinity excludes and is therefore bounded by the finite and therefore not in the literal German sense infinite. Its negation, meaning complement, is the finite, and and similarly the complement of the finite is the infinite and the two are co-determined (at least according to Hegel). Hegel then says that this process of negation as he described it should be taken to actually happen sequentiall, and that the "infinity of reason" is this finitude going into infinity and vice versa.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> "That finitude is internally determined to be finite; that it is intrinsic to finitude to be finite."

The more important point is that it is in the finite to become infinite. The infinite is what Hegel calls finitude's "Ansichsein".

"Therefore, the finitude of finitude is not contingent on anyexternal determinations."

Well, no, finitude already contains the concept of infinity and its "Ansichsein" is already in (bad) infinity, and similarly the conepto of bad infinity is finite in that it has a boundary. Therefore these two concepts are co-determinate and that is what makes the movement of one into the other possible that constitutes the infinity of reason.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I admit I might have explained it poorly. I think he is more clear that his talking about 'finite things', not finitude as finite. But then he moves into then he moves into the *Being of finitude* in the finite:

"But the point is, whether in thinking of the finite one holds fast to the being of finitude and lets the transitoriness continue to be, or whether the transitoriness and the ceasing-to-be cease to be. But it is precisely in that view of the finite which makes ceasing-to-be the final determination of the finite, that this does not happen. **It is the express assertion that the finite is irreconcilable with the infinite and cannot be united with it, that the finite is utterly opposed to the infinite.** Being, absolute being, is ascribed to the infinite; confronting it, the finite thus remains held fast as its negative; incapable of union with the infinite, it remains absolute on its own side; from the affirmative, from the infinite, it would receive affirmation, and would thus cease to be; but a union with the infinite is just what is declared to be impossible."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I agree. But as Thomas mentioned, that bad perspective is intrinsic to immediate understanding of the finite.

It's a great example of the necessity for immanent critique of that understanding; not to take the ideas merely as given.

That was the whole point of my explanation. So it's entirely pointless to disagree with me on a technicality which as yet to be established.

This is precisely the problem of formalism: that it fails to see the kernel of truth in what does not match up to our pre-conecieved understanding.

I wasn't even saying that infinity is excluded from finitude. You're imposing that; a concept can contain both infinity and finitude.
My language is actually pretty careful about that. 
Your "already" is precisely the mistake. This is all part of establishing the infinity of finitude. It cannot be brought in from outside: precisely the meaning of the section is the "immediacy of finitude"

One has to pass through this contradiction within the Being of Finitude, the holding the idea of finitude in one's mind, in order to find the infinite united in it.

To simply assert it misses the *movement*, misses the Reason, Vernuft of the logic.
If we don't follow the movement of how each moment comes-to-be, then we can't understand it from the logic itself, but are left importing our pre-conecieved ideas, wrongly.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> We are still talking about when you said that "the finitude of finitude is not dependent on any external determinations", right? Because I still think that Hegel doesn't think this is true:

"In jedem liegt hiermit die Bestimmtheit des Anderen, die nach der Meinung des unendlichen Progresses voneinander ausgeschlossen sein sollen und nur abwechselnd aufeinander folgen; es kann keines gesetzt und gefaßt werden ohne das andere, das Unendliche nicht ohne das Endliche, dieses nicht ohne das Unendliche.

"In each lies therefore the determination of the other, which, according to the opinion of the infinite progress are excluded from each other and can only follow each other sequentially.: one cannot be determined and captured without the other, the infinite without the finite and tha not without the infinite".</p>

"When we say of things that they are finite, we understand thereby that they not only have a determinateness, ... but ...non-being constitutes their nature and being. Finite things are, but their relation to themselves is that they are negatively self-related and in this they are negatively self-related and in this very self-relation send themselves away beyond themselves, beyond their being. They are, but the truth of this being is their end."

No, you are right in that the difference is between finitude and finite things: a particular finite thing is determined by having an end, meaning excluding something. But in this determination is already contained the notion of the bad infinite as the negative, meaning complement: the complement of a finite thing is infinite. But the finite is only characterized by not being infinite but becoming infinite and the infinite by not being finite.

"Nach ihrer nächsten, nur unmittelbaren Bestimmung genommen, so ist das Unendliche nur als das Hinausgehen über das Endliche; es ist seiner Bestimmung nach die Negation des Endlichen; so ist das Endliche nur als das, worüber hinausgegangen werden muß, die Negation seiner an ihm selbst, welche die Unendlichkeit ist."

"According to this next, only immediate determination is the infinite only the transcendence of the finite, it is in its determination the negation of the finite, as is the finite only that which has to be transcended, the negation at itself, wich is the infinity."

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> My understanding: the bad infinity is not mere bad in that it's negatively defined; but in being negatively defined as separate from finitude, finitude becomes it's other. The infinite cannot have an other: an other implies a limit.
He's says that would be a finitized infinite.
The true infinity is the the sublation of the finite and bad infinite, both are its moments.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Re: it's not just negation: 
Yes, its negation of negation (contradiction, '-' -> '--' -> '- and --' -> '- and +')

If positing comes from the realm of essence and positing is something we can do 'inside' and object in the chapter on being (he, does say things like 'now this is posited in this') then that means that at least some part of my loops-back-on-itself theory is correct (and of course it isn't my theory, its Zizek's theory of Hegel that you don't really know what is going on until the end of things 'the owl of Minerva alights at dusk').

So if-then (necessity) is the modern form of syllogism (syllogism was more limited than general necessity). However, we could say 'over-determined' which is a concept that means, at least in my reading, both determined by multiple things *and* determined as a contradiction (because if you are determined by multiple things, then the multiple things can determine in opposite directions which generates a contradiction). Over-determined is, of course, composed out of many possibly conflicting 'if-then' all competing with each other (thus it isn't separable from 'if-then' but begins to transcend it by way of generalization to a multiplicity of necessities).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> I don't think this quite captures it --- everything you're saying is true until I notice that this sequential movement back and forth between finite and infinite *can also* be sold as a 'progressive' (spurious) infinite (i.e. *this* movement from infinite to finite is the 367th movement between infinite and finite, the next one will be the 368th, etc.) Instead you have to reduce it to the level of a time crystal and ask what is simultaneously not a movement and movement or what is simultaneously infinite and finite and to me that would be an object like the Mandelbrot set (which is finite in that it can be written as something like a closed form infinitely self-recursed).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> That's why I say its fractal self-similarity: a finite thing which is also infinite (or rather, going on the difference between finite things and the spurious infinite, I would say that fractal self-similarity as a concept is the true infinite, and a particular self-similar fractal is one of the finite images of this whole concept which includes all such objects).</p>

As a concept we don't care about how we think about it because it is just the *inverse* to the finite which we can *hold* in our mind as something we can build on, or dig deeper into.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> No, because if you read carefully he never says that anything is "simultaneously infinite and finite" (he talks about finite infinity but that's slightly different and not about self-similarily but about the fact that this infinity has a boundary). He is careful in always saying that finitude is becoming infinity and vice versa, so this is clearly a sequential development, not a temporal one.

Wtf is a "time crystal"? Sounds like something from Bravest Warriors.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> > The ought as such contains limitation, and limitation contains the ought. Their relation to each other is the finite itself which contains them both in its being-within-self. These moments of its determination are qualitatively opposed; limitation is determined as the negative of the ought and the ought likewise as the negative of limitation. The finite is thus inwardly self-contradictory; it sublates itself, ceases to be. But this its result, the negative as such, is [a] its very determination; for it is the negative of the negative. Thus, in ceasing to be, the finite has not ceased to be; it has become in the first instance only another finite which, however, is equally a ceasing-to-be as transition into another finite, and so on to infinity.</p>

> But [b] closer consideration of this result shows that the finite in its ceasing-to-be, in this negation of itself has attained its being-in-itself, is united with itself. Each of its moments contains precisely this result; the ought transcends the limitation, that is, transcends itself; but beyond itself or its other, is only the limitation itself. The limitation, however, points directly beyond itself to its other, which is the ought; but this latter is the same duality of being-in-itself and determinate being as the limitation; it is the same thing; in going beyond itself, therefore, it equally only unites with itself. This identity with itself, the negation of negation, is affirmative being and thus the other of the finite, of the finite which is supposed to have the first negation for its determinateness; this other is the infinite.</p>

So when you say 'one thing made up of tiny versions of itself' the two perspectives are 'one thing' and 'tiny versions of itself' that aren't the same because the tiny versions aren't at the same level as the whole thing.</p>

I'm pretty sure when he gets to the critique of the Kantian perspective that he says that the contradiction between finite and infinite (in the sense of their eternal seperation, inability to reside in a single unity) isn't correct but I'll have to dig into that and don't have time right now.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> No, see, it's the other way around, he criticizes the idea of a unity:

"Diese Bestimmung des wahrhaft Unendlichen kann nicht in die schon gerügte Formel einer Einheit des Endlichen und Unendlichen gefaßt werden; die Einheit ist abstrakte bewegungslose[163] Sichselbstgleichheit, und die Momente sind ebenso als unbewegte Seiende. Das Unendliche aber ist, wie seine beiden Momente, vielmehr wesentlich nur als Werden, aber das nun in seinen Momenten weiter bestimmte Werden. Dieses hat zunächst das abstrakte Sein und Nichts zu seinen Bestimmungen; als Veränderung Daseiende, Etwas und Anderes; nun als Unendliches, Endliches und Unendliches, selbst als Werdende."

"§ 301

This determination of the true infinite cannot be expressed in the formula, already criticised, of a
unity of the finite and infinite; unity is abstract, inert self-sameness, and the moments are
similarly only in the form of inert, simply affirmative being. The infinite, however, like its two
moments, is essentially only as a becoming, but a becoming now further determined in its
moments. Becoming, in the first instance, has abstract being and nothing for its determinations;
as alteration, its moments possess determinate being, something and other; now, as the
infinite, they are the finite and the infinite, which are themselves in process of becoming."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> He criticizes both the unity and the separateness.
The result is clearly something extremely difficult to imagine or to grasp.
He goes on that it has both Existence and Being but not abstract Being.
"It *is*, and *is there*, present, before us."
But I don't think he means "before us" as in for us, this group, because I don't think any of us have quite got it 😬

Alex: do you know the German word Hegel uses for "posit"?
Do you know what he means by it?
Do you have any thoughts on this looping-back?

<@805731746384445460> I did explain earlier my thoughts becoming sympathetic to a different version of back propagating: that pure being is clarified through understanding determinate being, that pure being is being distinct from any of those thoughts.
For me this is not a logical back propagation, I suppose. It just reveals how many thoughts I smuggled in, and only notice when Hegel developed them explicitly</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> So this is related to section 290:

This yields the decried unity of the finite and the infinite — the unity which is itself the infinite which embraces both itself and finitude — and is therefore the infinite in a different sense from that in which the finite is regarded as separated and set apart from the infinite. Since now they must also be distinguished, each is, as has just been shown, in its own self the unity of both; thus we have two such unities. The common element, the unity of the two determinatenesses, as unity, posits them in the first place as negated, since each is supposed to be what it is in its distinction from the other; in their unity, therefore, they lose their qualitative nature-an important reflection for rebutting that idea of the unity which insists on holding fast to the infinite and finite in the quality they are supposed to have when taken in their separation from each other, a view which therefore sees in that unity only contradiction, **but not also resolution of the contradiction through the negation of the qualitative determinateness of both**; thus the unity of the infinite and finite, simple and general in the first instance, is falsified.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Then 293:

The falsification of the finite and infinite by the understanding which holds fast to a qualitatively distinct relation between them and asserts that each in its own nature is separate, in fact absolutely separate from the other, comes from forgetting what the Notion of these moments is for the understanding itself. According to this, the unity of the finite and infinite is not an external bringing together of them, nor an incongruous combination alien to their own nature in which there would be joined together determinations inherently separate and opposed, each having a simple affirmative being independent of the other and incompatible with it; but each is in its own self this unity, and this only as a sublating of its own self in which neither would have the advantage over the other of having an in-itself and an affirmative determinate being. As has already been shown, finitude is only as a transcending of itself; it therefore contains infinity, the other of itself. ®

Similarly, infinity is only as a transcending of the finite; it therefore essentially contains its other and is, consequently, in its own self the other of itself. The finite is not sublated by the infinite as by a power existing outside it; on the contrary, its infinity consists in sublating its own self.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> He isn't criticizing unity to say that there is no unity of opposites: he's criticizing it as a point contradiction (i.e. thinking that the unity of opposites is simply just nullity: nonsense, incomprehensible and unparseable).

The important line for me is just at the end of section 300:

"The infinite, therefore, as now before us is, in fact, the process in which it is deposed to being only one of its determinations, the opposite of the finite, and so to **being itself only one of the finites**, and then raising this its difference from itself into the affirmation of itself and through this mediation becoming the true infinite. 

That what escapes the typcial story of the infinite is the way that the infinite contains itself as a finitized infinite. This does lead to the various alephs (after all, in some sense the distinction between א-0  and א-1 is that 1-א is a reptition of the infinite within the infinite. A kind of infinite squared, its 'what if you have an infinite list of infinitely sized objects'). In that sense he's also talking about this division. But more importantly what he's saying is that in order for the infinite to be the *true infinite* it has to subordinate itself as a finite moment --- infinitely. And my point is that this is what a self-similar fractal accomplishes (or really I don't want to fall to far down this example path, what I mean is this is what self-similarity in general accomplishes: not just the fractals, but also the self-similarity held in the  א-0  and א-1 distinction which is the self-similar fractal taken to a very high level: of course there are further determinations but the trick is that we have that the two step from 'infinite as another finite' to 'infinite as the infinite of the finitude of the infinite').</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Or to put it another way 'infinite as the infinite *failure* of the infinite' --- which I would say is self-similarity (i.e. the self-similar is never really self-similar).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> And also as we get further --- the self-similarity of self-similarity itself is non-relation (which is this failure) because the only thing which the set of all self-similar objects has in common is the fact that they don't relate to other objects in the set (because if they did, then they would be the same object, because each object is self-similar) and this is held in common with the set as a whole not just between all the objects in the set which then means that the set as a whole is self similar only on this one kind of relation: non-relation.</p>

However, Hegel mainly uses it in the passive present, not the active perfect, so "es ist gesetzt", meaning "it is typed", not "es hat sich gesetzt", meaning "it sat down".</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> It is sometimes used in the passive, I suppose, as in "ich habe das kind ins auto gesetzt", "I sat the child into the car", but "es ist gesetzt" in this meaning, as in "it is sat" is unusual.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Apparently the english word 'posit' has roughly the same origin and meaning but from the Latin --- it means to place. So 'to posit in' something means 'to place in something' or 'to set in something.' But in English it has the further meaning of 'to assume' as in 'set a variable to zero' could also be written 'lets assume the variable is zero' or another way to think about it might be 'lets find zero in this variable' (i.e. yes the variable can vary over all of a space, but lets just limit it to this space --- zero). Of course, in order to so posit something as zero it must be *possible* to posit it that way (to set it that way) so there is still a relation of necessity --- the necessity of possibility. (or the ought --- I ought to be able to set this to zero... so I will and consider what happens then). That's the kind of necessity I think we're dealing with in Hegel, speculative necessity.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> From my investigations:
 "set" and "put" feel simplest; the connection to law, laws are "set" and "put" "in place". 

The word he uses for opposite = entgegengesetzt

From Google translate:
entgegen = in contrast to
gesetzt = set

Two opposites are "set in contrast to", posited in their contrast.
--
herabgesetzt - "reduced"
herab - down
gesetzt - set
---
herausgesetzt = exposed
Her = here
Ausgesetzt= exposed
Aus = out out of
Heraus = out of here
Exposed = Set out, set out of here
Set = exposed - out
---
Festgesetzt = fixed
Fest = firmly
Fixed = firmly set
Set = fixed - firmness
---
vorausgesetzten = prerequisites
vorausgesetzt = provided
Voraus = in advance
Vor = before
---
zusammengesetzt = composed, compound
zusammen = together, collectively, jointly
Composed = set together, put together

Idk if this is helpful, but it was fun. Alex can probably tell me I am off w some of these words.

It seems to have a very basic grammatical operation, like how in"set in relation to" or "put in relation to" the word "set" and "put" mean very little.
---

In the chapter in Essence where he discusses Posit*ing*(not posit*ed*), it is as "Positing Reflection" -"Die setzende Reflexion"
Setzende = setting (according to Google translate).

It's not clear what here is different simply being in Essence: Reflection: Shine, versus realm of Being: Existence.
But he defines "positedness": "self-sublating immediacy" and "immediacy purely as *determinateness* or self-reflecting".

I think something about immediate determination seems relevant. He seems to use in relation to determinations of concept in discussion</p>

§ 308

Thus the progress can be put in the following more characteristic form. The assertion is made: the finite and infinite are a single unity; this false assertion must be corrected by the opposite: they are absolutely different and opposed to each other; this must be corrected again by declaring that they are inseparable, that the determination of each lies in the other, by the assertion of their unity, and so on to infinity. What is required in order to see into the nature of the infinite is nothing difficult: it is to be aware that the infinite progress, the developed infinite of the understanding, is so constituted as to be the alternation of the two determinations, of the unity and the separation of both moments and also to be aware that this unity and this separation are themselves inseparable.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> In a sense. I believe so:
I think what he's developing rigorously here he says elsewhere, which is everything is as much mediated as immediate in different ways.
Like Being and Nothing only need to be immediate logically for their role in the beginning.
Babies are not born with the *concepts* of Being and Nothing; but the idea of empty consciousness is often related to (inferred) baby consciousness. 
It requires no concept; and in that sense it's difficult to attain, mediated by discipline of the mind.

But also, I have come to think, you don't have to *experience* emptiness to conceive of it. Holding part of your mind empty is enough to get the Idea.
But they're still abract in the sense of abstracting from all determinations.

And I think that's what he is developing on Essence: Reflection.
That we have to reflect on the way we meditate thoughts to "turn back" to immediacy. Or something.

Notice it's not immediacy as indeterminacy, like being, it's immediacy as determinateness.
Excited to get there together.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> I think the True Infinity is the transcendence of the failure.
The failure points to a beyond.
You can't stop with the failure; idk if you're referring to the bad or true infinite.

It kind of bothers me he doesn't develop a term for the bad infinity, ie the Beyond. I realize then the true infinity would then not have itself as a moment.
And that maybe a concept as Beyond, would not fit some standard for it to be a stand alone concept.
I'm curious if any of y'all have a sense of what those standards seem to be?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> So actually as I was looking at this I think that the key to what he means by the infinite, and how it is distinguished from spurious infinity is in the beginning of the next chapter when he talks about 'the one' as being-for-self which is  both its own being-in-itself and its own being-for-other: the point being that any self-similar loop is immediately infinite because it implies the possibility of infinity (i.e. that being-for-self relates to the infinite as determinate being relates to becoming: determinate being is the inner contradiction or internal movement to becoming's outer contradiction or outer movement). 

I think the infinite, Hegel's true infinite, is any finite that has two points that tie back to each other --- he says circle (and this is where the right Hegelians have a field day --- so many metaphors about God and circles come to mind along with demands for romantic return).  And that structure and all those metaphors 'count' (i.e. they're very 'whatever') --- but as we'll see in the next section it also includes the constant return to a place from which no return to the past can occur or to retreat a bit the constant haunting of the possibility that the point of return on that finite space will fall into *any other infinite than the one we were previously dealing with:* i.e. the acknowledgement that this point of return in the junction of the finite-infinite is an instability that can orient towards any other infinite-finite. 

To me this is what is means by 'there is no beyond' --- we can always find ourselves jumping into some other infinite (in fact I would say statements that prove incompleteness are these kinds of jumping off points for new infinities because they return you to the place where you have something true that can be proven axiomatically, showing that the axioms have to grow, and even if more powerful axioms cause the number to shrink again --- unless you have a poweful paraconsisstent base you have to grow axioms again).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> But doesn't he give us the term 'spurious (fake) infinite'?

So to me the standard of a spurious infinite would be something like the movement of an engine subject to the consumption of some fuel --- i.e. its going to run out at some point and then it will do nothing forever (but as a result it will be subject to whatever forces move beyond it to effect it). That's why its a fake infinite. And the only true infinite would be an infinite that sets up, perfectly, the conditions of its own continuation --- i.e. that would have 'no beyond' because its perfectly established all the conditions for it to repeat itself. And then looking into the next chapter on the one (and throwing in some Zizek and cliff notes reading) it appears that the only thing which does this is the void (i.e. the perfect non-relation, i.e. the only thing which always sets itself up to occur again is the *possibility* --- not certainty --- of the *failure* to relate perfectly to the next future step in the chain of causality --- which is a consequence of contradiction, because if you have anything other than the *possibility* of such failure as such a relation then you have being which is something other than nothing).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> What make the spurious infinite spurious isn't the repitition of it but rather the failure of repetition --- I'f I'm counting 1,2,3,4... --- 4 *is different* from 3 *is different* from 2, etc. I.e. I *failed* to repeat the previous number. When Hegel says the infinite is like a circle he means its a perfect reptition, not a partial repetition --- or rather that 'whatever the infinite is, its that which repeats perfectly' --- *not* that which repeats partially so that there is some way to measure how many repititions have occured. There should be no way to measure how many repetitions (and on the number line there is such a way, we just look at the number).</p>

Saying all this though actually perhaps were both missing the point here because bad infinity is infact qualitative at this point not quantitative which appears later in the SL and is considered a true infinity I believe by Hegel. Also spurious/bad infinity is infact endless repetition, at least according to David Gray Carlsons 'Comentary to Hegels Science of Logic"

"It is spurious because it names only the
endless autistic alternation between being
and non-being. It is not to be confused
with quantitative infinity, which will be a
true, not a spurious, infinite."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I don't think repitition is a sufficient criteria. "Om, Om, Om..." Could be the infinite by that definition.
It's not thag the alternating progression is problematic in it's not being repetitive. I don't remember him saying much about repitition at all.
When he says a circle, my understanding is that it's like spurious infinity and negativity spurious infinity joining.
Not like a circle you can draw.

The true infinity sublates finitude and the beyond. It includes it's opposite and its own failure.
Any description of infinite which involves an opposition would be false; the true infinite as much includes sequential progression as repitition.

The problem of the spurious infinite is that it is *the other* of the finite.
Even in a progression, it's a sense that the progression "to infinity"; but does not really say anything about what it is to, what is infinity, except it being beyond finite.
This beyond-ness, tho, makes infinite limited to the beyond, that is the beyond is separate from finitude.
But infinite cannot be limited.

That's the key to this whole section, Hegel returns to it many times.

The infinite cannot be thought as a beyond of finite because that would be  a restriction on infinite.

There's nothing the infinite is excluded from.

But it's also not just Being; it is being, but not abstract or pure being.

The image of the circle represents not repitition, but self reference. But it's not merely self reference; it's the self reference of everything - material and ideal.

He says the infinity is the basis of Ideality.
I think this is connected to what we were saying before: that finite things are connected to the infinite through the eternal nature of finitude.
That distinction between finite things and finitude has something to do w ideality and the way the infinite is in all things</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> "I don't think repetition is a sufficient criteria."

It is necessary and that's why I said perfect repetition --- i.e. repetition without any possibility of a counter. 

"The problem of the spurious infinite is that it is the other of the finite."

Its not that its the other of the finite I think, rather its that its otherness is externalized from the infinite rather than internalized. Its the *wrong* other of the finite. The circle is finite (i.e. its just a stupid object out it the world) but its infinite character is internalized as opposed to an unrolled oscillation on the number line. 

"This beyond-ness, tho, makes infinite limited to the beyond, that is the beyond is separate from finitude." --- I think he takes a stronger position here: not that it limits it to the beyond but rather that *there is no* beyond (i.e. the beyond is a contradiction, any time you encounter 'there is no' --- that means contradiction. There is no god: god is a contradiction, there is no subject: the subject is a contradiction, there is no woman: 'woman' is a contradiction, there is no proletariat: the proletariat is a contradiction). 

"There's nothing the infinite is excluded from" (Because the beyond is nothing, the infinite is excluded only from the beyond, because everything is excluded from the beyond or rather founded upon the contradiction of the beyond)

What I'm thinking of is self-similar fractals and recursive functions where the infinite object (the recursive function) is *representable* as a finite object (a function that calls itself) and in this sense as a pure function that calls itself --- sets itself up to be called again perfectly --- it is the true infinite. 

The circle would also be a true infinite --- any point flows into all other points on the circle perfectly (at least if it is a perfect circle). Its just that the circle isn't *all* that the infinite is. 

Its both repetition and self-reference (self-reference require repetition).</p>

I think you're missing the word 'perfect' in what I said. That modifier is doing a lot of work. An endless repitition (like on the number line) isn't perfect. If you have an actual perfect repetition then you can represent it as a finite recursive function: e.g.

def f(x):
    return f(x)

This would be a 'true infinity' (except of course it depends upon the drive of the computer and builds up stack, but if that is all abstracted away then it would be a true infinity: Hegel will go on further to develop that there is only the void as a true infinity I think in the next section but for now this suffices).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The "internalized" other is correct, more precise than what I was saying.

Where does he say "there is no beyond" that seems wrong to me. He says the true infinity has the bad infinity/the beyond as one of its moments.

The beyond is nothing in the sense that Pure Being is nothing; nothing has being here tho.
This is why this section and how we interpret it depends on and turns back to clarify the first chapter.

I don't think fractals, circles or anything can be but an analogy for the true infinity.
I think he literally means all that exists and the beyond are encapsulated on the true infinity. So maybe the true infinite has the form of something like a fractal. There does seem a recursiveness here. I don't know if it's necessarily "perfect repitition" tho.
That would be static, not a becoming. He says the true infinity is a becoming.

Like when you say "a perfect infinity" I don't think there can be *a* perfect infinity. That would suggest it is an existent, a something, and thereby finite.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I'm saying it in that formula... Hegel gets close with $302 --- where he says "It is *only* the spurious infinite which is the beyond, because it is only the negation of the finite posited as real — as such it is the abstract, first negation; determined only as negative, the affirmation of determinate being is lacking in it; the spurious infinite, held fast as only negative, is even supposed to be not there, is supposed to be unattainable."  And I hold him also to be saying that the spurious infinite is a pure contradiction (i.e. in other  places where he speaks about the contradictory unity of finite and infinite, its in the context of the spurious infinite). Further in that bit he says that the beyond is also the 'indeterminate' which I always take to be structured as a contradiction (undefined is always undefined becuase there are no answers and a multiplicity of answers which fit its structure lim x -> infinity 1/x is undefined --- indetermninate --- because its both positive and negative infinite). 

So I keep saying recursive fractals (and just to be clear, thought is structured as a recursive fractal, so I'm also talking about subjects here) because that is the most advanced object I can think of that meets his definition and it also sets us up for the next section where, I want to always formalize things as 'the x of x' --- i.e. the negation of negation, the determination of determination, the quality of quality, the something of something, the limit of limit, the finite of the finite, the infinite of the infinite, etc. And specifically if we really want to understand the void I'm saying 'oh yeah, that's the self-similarity of self-similarity (i.e. the infinite of the infinite). And I do think he means self-similarity, period, when he talks about the infinite (the fractals are an example).</p>

What makes it into a becoming is the fact that the self-similarity of self-similarity is non-relation: i.e. the only thing which *actually* perfectly repeats itself like this is non-relation or failure or... contradiction. That's why the infinite is a becoming, but he hasn't clarified that in this section. Its an untied reference (i.e. becoming itself, the movement between various states, contradiction, is infinite, is eternal, is transcendental, etc. --- there is a transcendental object, it just the transcendental object is the contradiction of the statement 'the only thing that doesn't change is demand for change itself' --- which is a nothing as well or to put it another way *there is no* transcendental object --- because the transcendtal object is contradiction itself).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0@firedog235#0</span> You also didn't reply to my point about the singularity of *the* true infinity.
I'm curious what you think, if you disagree.

I think this is a moment which clarifies the metaphysical nature of the text. It's not *just* a logic; the abstractions are not separated from physical world or actuality. It's about Being. 
<@638122715668152320> referred to metaphysics as outside the physical world.
I don't think that is what it means for Hegel or Aristotle.

What Hegel is saying here about Ideality and Reality is what I understand metaphysics to be about.

He seems to be basically saying with the infinite, ideality enters as affirmative content. Ideality unites finite things to the infinite, the ideal.

Does this passage make yall uncomfortable?

""§ 316

The proposition that the finite is ideal [ideell] constitutes idealism. The idealism of philosophy consists in nothing else than in recognising that the finite has no veritable being. Every philosophy is essentially an idealism or at least has idealism for its principle, and the question then is only how far this principle is actually carried out. This is as true of philosophy as of religion; for religion equally does not recognise finitude as a veritable being, as something ultimate and absolute or as something underived, uncreated, eternal. Consequently the opposition of idealistic and realistic philosophy has no significance.""</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I think this is the common understanding of contradiction (i.e. when I was learning symbolic logic this was what my brain spontaneously snapped to for contradiction --- what is the rational square root of 2? It just a 404 error.) This is not *all* of what a contradiction is, but its certainly the first order of what a contradiction is (before it *also* appears as a positive object that doesn't fit the context --- i.e. exception , or a movement between two possibilities within the context, or a single object that creates such a movement --- i.e. universal, and finally the it reappears as the need for such an object in all contexts).

The last thing is emptiness as such but before you can get there you have move through a specific emptiness, and not every step is an emptiness. 

The singularity of the true infinite is its multiplicity (he'll get into that in the whole point about the one vs. the many I think --- i.e. the true infinite is the very fractured nature of all other infinities).  I.e. the true infinite is contradiction because contradiction is, under some context, able to produce any particular object. That's what I meant when I was talking about infinite being failure and contradiction --- that its a singular object that fails to be a singular object.</p>

It doesn't make me uncomfortable... but with the huge caveat that I've been pretty certain most Marxists have an idealist notion of materialism for a long time (a lot of which is the fault of Stalinism impacting even the non-Stalinist strains of Marxism). When Marxists are like 'materialism is... the idea that the universe is made out of atoms (super bad) or even that production is primary in the relation of structure and superstructure (bad, but better) they're not really boiling materialism down into its primary idealist principle (i.e. they are not recognizing both how materialism must not only stand in opposition to idealism, but must also stand as an idealism --- i.e. must be a sublation of idealism --- and thus in what sense there is something eternal in materialism. For me, however, the key to materialism is the reduction of all possible eternal principles down to a single self-contradictory principle of contradiction). Thus, the problem with 'idealism' isn't that there isn't a 'one' but that people are constantly appealing to the wrong one, an inflated one, that is other than 'the void'.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Its not the spurious infinity --- I explicitly said to abstract away the stack and any other mechanism to count the recursions. 

Its not useless Jargon and I'm not just going 'aha maths = infinity' either. The reason I keep saying self-similar fractals (or rather, the reason I keep saying self-similarity itself which is the whole category of all such fractals) is because I've read ahead a bit and seen that Hegel is going to start talking about 'the one' and the 'the many' and 'the void' and 'non-relation'. And what I think is interesting is that the self-similarity of self-similarity itself (i.e. the way that the set of all self-similar objects is similar to each of the objects it contains) is that none of them relate to each other because if they did they would, definition-ally, contain each other (because if they relate to each other then you only need one of them to represent all of them --- i.e. if one of these objects contains another of these objects, then they are the same object because each of them is self-similar). And that means that non-relation is the self-similarity of self-similarity (just as the infinite is the finitude of the finite, the finite is the limitation of limitation, limitation is the something of something, something is the quality of quality, quality is the determination of determination, determination is the becoming of becoming, becoming is the nothing of nothing, and nothing is the negation of the negation). That's my understanding of how each of these things relates to the previous order of things --- that they're all negations and specifically they're all negations of negation so they call be turned against themselves.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> it is "unnecessary" jargon. What you described there is still spurious/bad infinity despite the slight of hand trick by "abstracting away" the stack. It is infinity of the understanding or common use, not the infinity of Reason.

It is debated whether the term should be bad or spurious anyway. Bad would imply that it is infinity only of a bad kind wheras spurious would imply its fake, not real infinity. The German terms Hegel uses are slecht(bad) and echt(true or really??).

I'd still like to hear you convincingly describe how Determinate Being progresses through Something/Other, Ought, Limit, finitude, Infinity and so on. Or part of it at least.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Its spurious (Hegel says explicitely at some point that its not a true infinity, i.e. fake --- I think the debate would be whether is *also* bad). 

That's not a 'slight hand trick' --- what I'm abstracting away is precisely all the bits that would make it spurious (i.e. I agree that yes, with a stack it would be spurious, yes, with a counter it would be spurious --- but if you abstract, i.e. strip out, all that stuff and leave it only as a pure recursion then its no longer spurious). Its like we're talking about cats and I'm saying 'a house cat like a lion except its smaller, friendlier to humans, poops in a box, descends from a different branch of the feline tree, etc. etc.' and then you're like 'no that's still a lion' even though my whole point is that I'm going strip out all the important differences between lion and a house cat.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Okay we start with determinate being (being with difference) and then we ask, what is the determinate being of determinate being itself --- i.e. how does it differ from just pure being (i.e. determine itself as separate from) and the answer is quality; the determinate being of determinate being is quality (i.e. determinate being is seperate from being because it has qualities). And then we say okay, how does quality qualify itself (i.e. what quality does quality itself have to have to be a quality) and the answer is it has to be the quality of a something (that is, when I say there is 'blue' the quality of 'blue' is what kind of thing its attached to --- I can have a car blue, or a sky blue, or an ocean blue, or etc. i.e. the quality of the quality blue is what particular object its attached to out in the world). So that means we now have 'something' as an object (a qualities that other qualities adhere to) each of whose qualities is a determination (i.e. difference from something else). 

Now what is the something of something? This is where the whole discussion about objects for themselves and objects for other come in but the point is that now the something is relation to another thing in the same way a quality was in a relation to something and the answer, according to hegel, is that the something of something, its in-itselfness (what it is) is its limitation: the boundaries which say 'this is this and that is that'. This is some other object that the something relates to both as its opposite and as its definition (it is defined as *not* that other thing, i.e. by its limit) and which it also includes (i.e. a line is not a point, but it is all the points between two points). This all eventually piles up in the *ought* which is the limitation of limitation and which is also the finite. The ought is the overcoming of limitation, and since every limitation comes paired with an ought (i.e. the limitation is itself limited) the finite produces the infinite.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> Except for one important detail, cats exist, computers without a stack don’t. You can’t just abstract away the parts of something that don’t fit your argument. Not that it’s an argument anyway I don’t really see the point of your analogy, I don’t think that’s true infinity at all. As for fake infinity or not I’d like to see the page reference. I’m not saying there may not be good arguments for it being spurious as a posed to bad</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> What are you trying to say by that analogy? That this hypothetical computer would be able to compute infinity instantaneously? That would mean it’s reached the end and its not infinite. Or do you mean the computation would just go on indefinitely for ever? Then it’s just the same as spurious infinity. Giving a real world example of infinity is to explain it from the understandings perspective which Hegel says is bad infinity.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> In the second paragraph your explanation is EXTREMELY bare bones and you gloss over things like being-for-other/in-itself, which are crucial to understand finitude. You don’t even mention constitution or determination. Just saying this concept is a limitation of the previous comment, the next concept is the limit of that one is just to very loosely define dialectical progress in general. You could say that about every concept in the book and say there we go, nailed it!</p>

Yes, outside, but not separated, at least in the strong sense you're proposing. Rather, the ideas are "incarnated" in (among other things) the physical world. This is pretty certainly true for Aristotle, and I'd say also for Hegel (compare also David Corfield's comment that to Hegel not Plato but Aristotle was the true father of idealism, as he provided a concept for how those ideas are instantiated. Sadly, I can't find that comment right now though). In fact, that is already inherent in Hegel's comment on the Platonic ideas in the introduction:</p>

The Platonic Idea is the universal, or more definitely the Notion of an object; only in its Notion does something possess actuality and to the extent that it is distinct from its Notion it ceases to be actual and is a non-entity; the side of tangibility and sensuous self-externality belongs to this null aspect.

Not at all, as noted in the passage I quoted Hegel seems to assume that the Notion is the only thing that is true about an object, this is just an attack on anti-idealism, which I don't subscribe to.</p>

But nothing definitely not negation of negation.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Computer's without stacks exist, stacks were a thing that was invented, they aren't magical things that always existed. And there are programming languages that don't operate with the stack. For example, scheme (which is not a language I tend to use, but never the less it exists) can reuse the current functions frame if it uses tail optimization. There's also such a thing as stackless python. 

As for why spurious definitely means 'false' and (and may only incidentally mean 'bad'): see $302:

"It is only the spurious infinite which is the beyond, because it is only the negation of the finite posited as real — as such it is the abstract, first negation; determined only as negative, the affirmation of determinate being is lacking in it; the spurious infinite, held fast as only negative, is even supposed to be not there, is supposed to be unattainable. However, to be thus unattainable is not its grandeur but its defect, which is at bottom the result of holding fast to the finite as such as a merely affirmative being. It is what is untrue that is unattainable, **and such an infinite must be seen as a falsity**. "</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> What I'm trying to say with that analogy is that the very fact that we can symbolize the infinite with a finite object (a name, a function, a fractal, etc.) that *always returns to itself perfectly* that we git the true infinite. In section $302 again:

"This infinite, as the consummated return into self, the relation of itself to itself, is being-but not indeterminate, abstract being, for it is posited as negating the negation; it is, therefore, also determinate being for it contains negation in general and hence determinateness. It is and is there, present before us. " 

i.e. the infinite is 1) a relation of itself to itself that is 'consumated' 2) its not indeterminate (undefined --- or 'beyond') 3) it is and is there, present before us (i.e. we can see the whole damn thing).

And to me the only things like that are, perfectly self relating objects like: circles, recursive functions, fractals, etc. (i.e. the set of self-similar objects).

I think the real problem here is when Hegel says that he doesn't like the 'finitized infinite' and its easy to over-read. The finitized infinite he's talking about there is an *externally* finitized infinite (i.e. an infinite which the finite is trying to 'count' or 'run' in relation to some finite measure). What he wants is an *internally* finitized infinite which is the same as the *internally* infinitised finite -- I.e. an infinite in which some limit of an otherwise finite object is totally looped back on itself in a manner that removes it as a limit. Comparing a circle to a line is useful if we remember he already discussed lines in the section on the finite and how they are limited by a point --- but in a circle there is no such limitation to work with (a circle is not bound by two points).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Also let me deal with these more precisely:

That this hypothetical computer would be able to compute infinity instantaneously? --- no, that's not what I'm saying. 
Or do you mean the computation would just go on indefinitely for ever? --- it would do that, but that *perspective* is the spurious infinite. Internally it will always be either just entering or just exiting itself in a way that can not be counted and has nothing to do with 'forever time' because it only has a time space where it can be in one of two states (just entering or just leaving itself). Yes it 'goes on forever' from an external perspective, it is externally finitized as a spurious infinite by the finite. But it does more than that: internally, it is *always* (eternally) present in a finite number of states: which is the true infinite (when a finite object overcomes its limitation through a total separation from other finite objects --- which also means the total elimination of of the limit those other finite objects represent, in this case the function 'f' has become totally separated from other functions by virtue of the fact that there is no way to reach those function from inside 'f').</p>

I feel like you're either just trying to put me through my paces or asking me to spoon feed the section on finitude to you, considering it doesn't have much to do with the finite outside the sections on limit and ought.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0@minimaltom#0</span> I'm not convinced that's all it is: I think there is an idealism to materialism (I think materialism is a proper sublation of idealism which means its an idealism of idealism: it basically turns towards idealism itself and says 'this is finite' and then does the same trick idealism here performs but against idealism itself). However, the only way it can strip idealism down to finitude is by taking a small portion of it and maintaining that portion: the portion which allows the finite to also be infinite. I also realized what all the stuff about division was about in conversation with <@589918821729566721>  --- its that the true infinite strips out limitations from finite objects by permanently separating them *from other finite objects* in the same way that a circle is permanently separated from a pair of points as its limits (and the only important point about it that becomes its limit, the center of the circle, is permanently separated from the circle itself --- i.e. not in contact with the circle).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> Yea I think there are many mistakes in here.
The whole move of "how does quality qualify itself" and "what is the something of the something" is wrong and just made up.

I think the rest of us are trying to really understand the text, especially *how it moves* from on moment to the other.

Are you interested in this, Thomas? Or just sharing random thoughts that feel related to you? Bcs that's fine, I just think we should just understand that's what you are offering</p>

This is only true if you follow the logic step by step, holding the thoughts in your mind, meaning starting with empty consciousness, emergence of becoming, etc..

I think what Hegel would assume is that to actually hold infinite in your mind in this passage would be a truly sublime, awe inspiring experience.

Talking about it in terms of programs or computers externalizes it from our own thoughts.

The fact that "to me the only things like that are..." Only speaks to your refusal to consider new thoughts, precisely what is necessary for this book</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Hegel is very explicit that it is precisely problematic to bring outside thoughts into this.
This is attempting fundamental truths on their own terms.

To say he is wrong about things, especially without really understanding what he is saying, is to presuppose you already have a better method. 
I'd go so far to say there is no point to reading this book of you are unwilling to question your prior beliefs.

Personally, I would give up materialism and become religious if the book convinced me the Truth of God.
It's not just a matter of Hegel's argument making sense on its own terms, but that I understand his terms and come to agree with them.
Unlike any other logic I have seen, he is at least attempting to fully develop the terms internally.
So I think to claim he is wrong necessitates where his mistake in reasoning is, which requires understanding his reasoning, how me moves from step to step.
And since you can't do that, i just don't take seriously claims he is wrong.

I'm sure he is wrong somewhere. But can't merely compare his to our pre-conecieved thoughts. His will be the more rigorous until we can sublated his method</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> This is very important passage from Something and Other, paragraph 228, regards both positing and the relation of finite and infinite:

"In the sphere of being, determinate being only proceeds from becoming, or, with the something an other is posited, with the finite, the infinite; but the finite does not bring forth the infinite, does not posit it. In the sphere of being, the self-determining even of the Notion is at first only in itself or implicit — as such it is called a transition; and the reflected determinations of being such as something and other, or finite and infinite, although they essentially refer to each other or are as a being-for-other, they too count as qualitative, as existing on their own account; the other is, the finite ranks equally with the infinite as an immediate, affirmative being, standing fast on its own account; the meaning of each appears to be complete even without its other. On the other hand positive and negative, cause and effect, however much they may be taken as isolated from each other, are at the same time meaningless one without the other. "</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I think here how something is 'posited' is equated with being-for-other, how something is explicitly determined by its opposite or 'reflected' in it, as apposed to being-in-itself which is merely implicitly determined.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> the way something is inwardly determined in-itself is really interesting tho. From what I've read in Houlgates book It is internally determined by ceasing to be itself but still retaining what it is in the process. if it didnt cease to be yet retain its essense (maybe wrong term) it wouldn't be determined.

Ill try and find the section Houlgates refering to.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> also in the paragraph before that, 227 Hegel equates being-in-itself with the Kantian thing-in-itself in which we have only empirical knowledge but lack access to the thing, we know nothing about it. He says that Kants definition of thing-in-itself is only the case if you take a things being-in-itself in isolation from its being-for-other. The truth is that something is internally and externally determined at the same time removing the seperation between the thing and our perception of the thing.</p>

"This expression (positedness), it is true, includes also being-for-other, but it specifically contains the already accomplished bending back of that which is not in itself into that which is its being-in-itself" (228)</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> The passage on constitution is hard to parse but if you slow down enough to follow his difficult language, it is developing this internal vs external determination.
Constitution is external determination, the way the other determines something.
He then sublates them together in something: since something is internally determined to be determined by other, the constitution (external) is implicit in the (internal) determination.

Posited is this external determination, I think, the very nature of something posits an other; the other is constituted by this external positing of the something 

This is how he is moving from in-itself, to for-other, to more concrete in-itself, to the explicit unity of the two. 
Then "the negation is now immanent"
 "something behaves in this in relation to it's other *through itself*"
(These are from Cambridge translation)
"Now has its affirmative existence through its intermediary alone"</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> This seems to be consistent with what I've gathered constitution to mean more generally, that its the way something is altered by something else (re-constituted maybe? or just constituted) while simultaneously retaining its identity.

Im foggy on this tho so id have to reread the section.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I literally said that the level of 'nothing' is confused because I think Hegel reverses it from an actual science of logic (for reasons that have to do with the social context of German Idealism --- I also think this explains why he calls something 'the first negation of negation', because all his movements are just negation of negation applied recursively to the previous steps... but he wants to avoid that position for reasons having to do with ideology). 

So I think that the definition of quality that Hegel gives in $196 is --- Determinateness thus **isolated by itself** in the form of being is quality. Okay so let's first compare that to what I've said... 'the determinate being of determinate being'--- i.e. the definitely limited being of definitely limited being --- i.e. the way in which the entire order of being that is determinate being is separated or limited out from other orders of being, objects, categories, etc.? OMG, that looks like what Hegel calls quality, i.e. Determinateness is thus **isolated by itself** in the form of being, and I call that quality (and Hegel calls that quality).

As far as it being 'existent determinateness' (existing predictability --- citation needed, btw) --- isn't the thing which seperates determinate being from other forms of being its existence? I.e. isn't the definitely limited being of definitely limited being found in how it demands consistency (existence in Hegel's terms, not actuality) as opposed to indeterminate being (undefined, contradictory) being that its stands within and is merely a piece of?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> First of all, I do go through every detail in the first pass. However, the only time every single detail is important is when you're running an argument like a computer and you want to know if it crashes. At that level, Hegel's argument has already crashed as far as I'm concerned (it crashed when he said we should focus on being rather than nothing). So now I'm playing in the space of arguments like Hegel's, the ways to make what is already a broken and bad program function so that I can figure out *what he meant by it* and *what I can get from it* which means that bits and pieces are going to be thrown out in trying different similar arguments to try and find what is important and structural vs. what is incidental vs. what is nonsense. 

But also like, not every detail passes through to every part of the argument? There are conceptual barriers here (limit and ought act as barriers between the finite and infinite for example --- like you don't need a really deep articulated understanding of quality to understand the finite if you have a pretty good understanding of what is going on in limit and ought). I.e. not every step is important for establishing every other step of the argument --- the structure of the argument can remain sound even while the individual steps are crap.  

For example I'll make this argument:

The sky is blue
All men are mortal
All mortal men die
Socrates is a man

:::Socrates will die

The fact that the sky is blue is incidental. Like your claim that we need to get super hung up on every detail all the time forever in every context from now until the end of the world *feels* principled and it *feels* like its correct... but actually its crap. 

You can't see the forest for the trees --- that's why you don't understand the concepts and you have no conclusion whatsoever.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Yeah, this is my interpretation of what Hegel is doing, its my cliff notes of how it moves from one moment to another. So far every time you've tested me in this context (i.e. when I have time to actually go through the pile of receipts, not when there is time pressure) what has happened? I've always gone to the text and been like 'I'm saying this because the text says that and look, aren't they not that dissimilar?'

Of course I'm interested in it. The bit on infinite is some of the most interesting writing I've encountered in the past couple years. If I wasn't interested in it I wouldn't write to you about it here... I'd just chuckle at you and go about my day. 

As far as quality qualifies itself --- see $206 where Hegel says that quality is *especially* a property: i.e. it is the quality of qualities as a category to be the quality (property) of something --- or to flip it around reading that same section: "The more stable determinatenesses, on the other hand, such as figure, shape, are not called properties, nor even qualities perhaps, because they are conceived as alterable, as not identical with the being [of the object]." That is, things which are 'stable determinateness' (apply to many objects), such as figure and shape, are not considered to be qualities (perhaps) of the object, for Hegel (and in his tradition) because they can be changed and the object remains the kind of object it is. Specifically something is *something* because it has a particular set of properties, or rather, a particular set of qualities. It is the quality of quality that it be the quality of *something*. Quality qualifies itself (because if I say quality of quality I can also say qualified quality and strip out the 'of' and have the meaning remain the same) as *something*. (Or to put it yet another way, if quality is defined as the *definitional difference* of a thing, then the definitional difference of quality from other determinations is the way it applies to *something*).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Yes, --- i.e. the definitely limited being of definitely limited being --- i.e. the way in which the entire order of being that is determinate being is limited out from other orders of being, objects, categories, etc. 

In hegels statement: Determinateness is thus isolated by itself in the form of being --- there are two limitation going on. The first is determinateness itself (which is the first limitation) and the second is the limit placed on the first limitation (and he adds 'in the form of being' transforming determinateness into determinate being). So we get Determinate (determinate being) thus isolated by itself (determinate being) in the form of being, is quality. 

We can even go to the very first sentence of the remark: "In determinate being (a) as such, its determinateness is first of all (b) to be **distinguished** as quality." --- i.e. the thing about determinate being that makes it determinate being, its determinateness, is also its quality because quality is just determination applied to determination.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Yeah, that's because you don't yet think of your own mind as a program running on a computer, whereas I do. So I'm not externalizing. 

Just because its squishy and made of organic chemicals doesn't make your mind into 'not a computer'. It seems to me you really want to bring mysticism into this discussion. You want the soul to be made of something other than 'millions of tiny robots'. Sorry, its not. 

The sublime is the unkowable (i.e. its so vast and complicated and *beyond* that we don't know what it is)... so if that's what Hegel wants (for us to not understand what he's saying, for it to be impossible for us to understand) then we should rebel against him. The other side of the sublime is the obscene (the totally known) and I think that's our primary disagreement. I want an obscene Hegel, I don't care about making him sublime, I want to know him so totally that I know exactly what is shit and what isn't (i.e. I want to cut him open and see all his guts splayed out on the ground). What I want is the sublimity of the obscene (i.e. the you don't know just how much you know). You seem to want the obscenity of the sublime (i.e. you know that you will never know) and I'm just not here for that.</p>

My experience is they have been dissimilar more times than not.
Thats fine; it's just very hard to have a conversation when you refuse to acknowledge you're wrong. I'm not saying you're wrong about everything, but when you are wrong, instead of being open to it being pointed out, it becomes a rabbit hole of falsifications of the text.

Quality: you are clearly twisting the words: by "in the form of being" , he means "in immediacy".
If you slowed down to understand the terms you would understand why.

"Determinateness thus isolated by itself in the form of being is quality — which is wholly simple and immediate."
 
"quality as a determinateness which is only immediate or only in the form of being."

"In the form of being" is not a "limit" by which I hope you mean negation, limit is derived from something and other, so premature.

The form of being is immediacy. This is important for understanding the book. The for of "determinate being" is not immediacy, it's mediated.
Hence why "determinate being of determinate being" is wrong. It's almost the opposite.

Re: property:
He actually says:
"Quality is especially a property only where, in an external relation, it manifests itself as an immanent determination"

The "only" is pretty important thing to cut out.

We don't have any immanent determinations yet, so it's irrelevant. This is taken out of context from a remark discussing Spinoza's proposition that determinateness is negation.

More to the point: your claim
"Something is *something* because it has a particular set of properties"

Is entirely wrong and shows you have spent much time with the something, or something and other.</p>

Cells are not robots, the brain might be *like* a computer, but I don't know any evidence that it *is* a computer.
Do you *experience* your mind as a computer?

What the realm of Being is about is thoughts immediately in the mind. So translating it to computer terms is externalizing it, or at least mediating it by another intellectual system</p>

"I think the rest of us are trying to really understand the text, especially *how it moves* from one moment to the other.

Are you interested in this, Thomas? It's okay if you're not"

You said yes, but seem to not be addressing the specificity of what I'm saying.
I see you're interested in the text. But it doesn't seem like you're interested in taking it step by step, understanding each term in its own derivation.
Ie not bringing limit into understanding of quality.

It's really okay if you just want an intuitive sense of it. 
I'm sorry I'm getting so heated.
Maybe we are just having different conversations bcs we want different things from the text.

Not everyone who reads it cares to follow each movement, but just wants the main ideas and a feel for the movement.

Personally, that is not what interests me. Especially bcs the infinite is so fascinating, it's motivated me to retrace the previous development to understand what he means.
To understand *how* he gets to it from emptiness in two chapters is astounding and beautiful, I'd say sublime but I don't want to be misunderstood 😉
I'm really interested in, not just the steps, but the transitions, bcs I want to learn about thought itself, immanently.
That's just what I want and I don't mean to put you down for whatever you want.</p>

No, my use of 'in form of being' is not meant to mean 'negation' --- I point it out to say that quality and determinatess are still in the realm of being (i.e. its not just 'determinateness' that Hegel is talking about but rather 'determinate being'). The negation is in the determinateness and then a second time in the isolation of (determination of) that determinateness, not in being in my interpretation.

Also --- because determination is difference, it's possible for it to have immediate access to difference within itself 'as such'. That is, it's possible for me to say this sentence: what determines determination against all other objects is its immediate access to determination which other objects have to always import from determination as a mediation --- i.e. its possible to have immediate access to mediation and to mediate immediacy  --- to define something as being different though its immediacy (or to return to the immediate from the mediation of determinate being, to double mediate back into immediacy). 

I'm not claiming that determinate being is immediacy, I'm claiming that its determination is its immediate access to determination (i.e. there is an immediate mediation/mediated immediacy in determination) --- there's an important distinction there.</p>

Its only important if its a distinction that makes a difference. Do you mean its important because qualities are also 'immanent' --- (because it can't be because you think that this weakens the argument that the quality of quality is something: because it only strengthens that argument). But I don't have a problem with the idea that qualities are immanent. That isn't a point of contention. See above.</p>

It's not defined as unknowable and I’m not saying it arbitrarily --- it just is unknowable, as part of its bigness and grandeur --- If it's knowable then it’s as small as the human mind and thus *not* sublime. Its unknowability is just a consequence of its bigness. You can mean whatever you want and if it turns out you don’t want the downside of the sublime with its upside you should pick a different word (though secretly at the Zizekian level I would whisper to myself that you’re just doing petit-bourgeois ideology because you want the upside without the downside, you don’t want to pay for your advancement, you want ‘x without x’ i.e. ‘the sublime without the sublime’).</p>

Why are thoughts immediately in the mind not programs running in a computer? And you can call it ‘mediation by another intellectual system’ but it could just as easily be called ‘the attempt to internalize another intellectual system into Hegel’s system.’ And also I’m deeply suspicious of this notion that has popped up that we shouldn’t be appealing to these other ideas: I don’t think you really understand something (or to put in hegeleze, can really rationalize it --- because I’m talking about the rational here, not the understanding) until you can restate it in another context. It doesn’t really become itself until it returns to itself in an alien form. Otherwise you’re just parroting it.</p>

No, I mean mysticism as an appeal to the sublime, to the beyond. Super-naturalism. The idea that whatever is going on doesn't rest on a material foundation. For example the idea that what is going on the mind is fundamentally different from computation rather than, for example, just a hyper specific form of computation.</p>

I do this every time I read a chapter, I go through each step. Using the term limit was an attempt to clarify what I meant for you --- well really for Tom (i.e. not just repeat 'quality of quality' at you until I'm blue in the face --- to try and aid your intuition to understand what I mean by quality of quality but... like you want to do this the hard way so okay let's do it the hard way).

What I want is for us to first proceed as if the other person is an intelligent human who is trying to understand things (i.e. to first attempt to understand what I'm saying and see how the text, I don't know, might support it, rather than saying 'oh yeah, I didn't immediately get that so it must be bullshit and you're a bullshitter'... which is very annoying and of course if people are going to be an asshole to me then I'll be an asshole back).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> § 191

From becoming there issues determinate being, which is the simple oneness of being and nothing. Because of this oneness it has the form of immediacy. Its mediation, becoming, **lies behind it**; it has sublated itself and determinate being appears, therefore, as a first, as a starting-point for the ensuing development. It is first of all in the one-sided determination of being; the other determination, nothing, will likewise display itself and in contrast to it.</p>

isolated by itself doesn’t mean what you claimed it to mean, ei isolated from other forms of being (objects, categories), this is such an eccentric understanding of he phrase because you’re trying to fit it into your preconceptions. it means isolated in its immediate-ness from its mediation which will be brought to light again in the form of negation.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> Why do you assume the burden on us is to understand your unfounded takes like 'something is the quality of quality' rather than on yourself to explain them coherently??? Or at least in the terminology of the book were reading.

You seem to assume that just saying 'quality of quality' over and over is sufficient and that it should be somehow self-evident and you are unfairly forced to "do it the hard way" and explain your self.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> here again, and this one is glaringly obvious, You quote Hegel as saying "Quality is *especially* a property" as if this is a completed statement and take it to mean something like Quality is 'very importantly' a property, (you even italicise especially  but you ***incredibly*** fail to see that this is only part of the sentence. The full sentence is

"Quality is especially a property ***only where, in an external relation, it manifests itself as an immanent determination.***"

Completely changing the meaning of the word 'especially'</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0@minimaltom#0@firedog235#0@dve.h_37844#0</span> You want us to treat you like you're not a bullshitter, but we are just repeatedly telling you that we experience you as interacting in bad faith.
You're not taking us seriously in pointing out we think you're misunderstanding the text. And using terms which seems blatantly muddled. And when we point this out, you only make it more complicated and more muddled.

So no, we're not going to work so hard to parse your turgid convolutions when You've broken the basic trust of admitting when you're wrong about the text.

I mean it's clear from what you said you *are* reading it differently and have quite different intentions than the rest of us.
I am not at all convinced that Hegel is wrong is starting with both Being and Nothing, rather than only nothing.
Do you not think nothing has being?
What argument do you have for this?

I just really think your claim that you don't have to follow the argument closely to understand later concepts is incorrect. Each term is developed immanently, and needs to be understood by that development.

But doing a smash and grab reading is fine; just why I have been asking whether you are wanting what we seem to be.

I'm curious if <@638122715668152320> and <@589918821729566721> agree w my interpretation that they want to understand the text on its own terms in its immanent development? Also <@1144442476145426592> ?

But if you're doing a different reading it makes sense we would be frustrated with each other not following unstated expectations.
We are asking for understandings based on the text and you, to do your own thing, "playing in the space".

I appreciate you explaining your intentions.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> the claim that "you don't have to follow the argument closely to understand later concepts" is completely absurd, even moreso in relation to this particular text, I think Hegel himself makes that pretty clear in the prefaces intro and with what should we begin.

Also I think youd be hard pressed to find a scholar of hegel or otherwise that would think that, unless perhaps some really unusual popstmodernists</p>

Im becoming more and more convinced that even if he is wrong that hes not completely wrong. I can already hear Thomas saying this validates his approach of

"bits and pieces are going to be thrown out in trying different similar arguments to try and find what is important and structural vs. what is incidental vs. what is nonsense. "</p>

I just wanted to share this interesting perspective of Stephen Houlgates about the term determinateness or determinacy

"Determinateness is simply the moment of “nonbeing” (Nichtsein) that ren- ders all being stable and definite."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Im not sure a lot of people hold this view but if hes right, Hegels definition of quality "Determinateness isolated by itself in the form of being" becomes non-being isolated by itself in the form of being.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> I think the whole thing hinges on Hegel's conceptions of thought in immanent movement; how he sees thoughts moving immanently.
The way he conceives the whole project.
I think that probably is wrong to some extent, to what extent? It seems remarkably undetectable to me so far. Which would say small; but even so, the whole thing might collapse if so.

But I think we could only say, imo, by understanding it fully and being able to step outside of it. When we think we have found a mistake, I believe we really ought to question ourselves; what are our prior beliefs on which our critique is grounded, are they able to be justified in such rigor?

I think learning it has helped me a ton to slow down and notice my own assumptions and modes of thought.
If I could find something I think is wrong in Hegel, and develop it as rigorously as SoL, I would certainly not feel depressed that Hegel was wrong.

That would be a very important contribution to humanity, imo.
Even Marx did not attempt to develop his own Logic; so it is of course exceedingly ambitious.
Many critics have been shown to be smuggling in unwarranted assumptions, ie lacking self awareness and rigor.

But to me, the value in all this is developing that self-awareness and sense of rigor. Not the conclusions themselves; although if they seem true, one must take them seriously as well</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> yes many people claim that there is outward influence or contingency involved in the progression which is often equated with understanding. Zizek says theres a silent 4th pulling the strings like "the dummy in a game of bridge" and says its the master signifyer</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> the stand out fact about Houlgate is actually that he claims the whole progression in immanently logical without any external influence and I think its a fairly unique position.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> but Hegel himself claims it is immanent altho theres a little passage where he equates the understanding with "external reflection"</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Yeah I kind of believe when some historical figure is held in such high esteem by the world they go beyond the individual person that say hegel or aristotle were in themselves and become like a relic and its fair to give them a certain ammount of benefit of the doubt. Marxists obviously do this to an intense degree 😄</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> So 'not mediated' --- i.e. a negation of mediation? To me what is important isn't 'categories, objects' the reason I listed that out is because there is a word-I-don't-know-what, but what is important is that to isolate something is to negate its connection to something else. So even if you say 'isolated in its immediate-ness' --- you are still negating its potential connections to other things in this moment of analysis (i.e. you're mediating it down to its immediacy).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0@minimaltom#0@nameiwillforget#0</span> No. You started out from that position from moment one and have decided I'm a bullshitter from the ground up and. YOU slandered me the very first day by saying I didn't read anything and you got it into your head that was the way things are and have been a consistent ass to me. But that's not how things are --- like even when you come back with 'well there's this particular detail I don't like'  as in the previous statement what do I say, 'well it isn't important to the argument' (i.e. 'object, category') but the overall argument is not wrong because...' once again... the argument has details that can be swapped out for other details. Its an argument SPACE not a particular argument. Like you're focusing on the stuff which isn't important (whether or not determinateness is isolated from 'categories, objects' while ignoring the point that I'm actually making which is that immediacy is 'not mediated'). Like you aren't really into the question of what is 'provably false' --- you're into the question of 'is Thomas completely perfect and is there anyway to gish-gallop his argument 'cause fuck that guy.' 

Like I have disagreements with <@476561351167311872> and also with <@638122715668152320> and sometimes we're able to resolve them and sometimes not, but you started this whole process out being an absolute ass to me in the most disgusting way.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> No my whole point was that saying 'quality of quality' over and over is a bad practice and I was trying to aid the intuition with the word limit but apparently that was a bridge too far... so the hard way means mucking about with the previous concepts (iterating over things at a lower level in a hard way).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> No, its not a smash and grab reading. I think that the being of nothing is the effects of contradictions (this my own idea, seperate from Hegel). I want to understand the text as well, However, I don't think you understand the text until you restate in a radically different way and context that continues to be true to the text. Until that happens your just parroting it (i.e. you 'understand' it in the Hegelian since but haven't 'rationalized' it --- the english language is getting dumb here).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I didn't say you don't have to follow the argument closely to understand later concepts. What I said was that there are conceptual breaks such that once you understand the argument (have followed it closely) you don't have to entail every single step of the argument in every single conversation all the time always every day every moment to be able to talk about this (i.e. when I say 'limit' I mean 'and everything entailed by 'limit' --- if you don't understand 'limit' then yeah, you won't understand any argument based on 'limit': but I don't need to say 'quality' because 'quality' is already wrapped up inside of 'limit'). 

And because every single fucking claim I make has to be 100% secure and backed up (I guess) --- you can find that in § 197 (that quality will be further determined as 'limit')</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> I guess non-non-being would be whatever non-being isn't, Being? I feel your trying to ask what is non-being in the form of nothing? I don't know, I'm not sure that would be non-non-being tho. I don't know if it makes sense. Or maybe it turns out to be negation of quality or simple negation.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0@minimaltom#0</span> Okay so let's go with 'being' --- i.e. mediated mediation might just be immediacy. The reason why I quoted § 191 is because Hegel seems in that section to be placing immediacy *after* mediation (i.e. determinate being is first this mediated becoming and *then* it has the form of immediacy, it seems we need to negate from mediation into immediacy: however I admit that may 'the form of' is a modifier that means 'is not really' so I'm not certain. Actually, looking it up it seems to mean 'what it is without differentiation'... however this notion of what determinate being is without differentiation is coming *after* its mediated moment in becoming... so there's that). And my understanding is that when <@476561351167311872> is saying 'it can't be the determinate being of determinate being' he's objecting based on the question of immediacy: that determinate being is a mediation. But Hegel seems to have a more complicated relationship in mind between determinate being and immediacy/mediation as well as a more complicated relationship between mediation and immediacy themselves.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> And as a materialist --- if being is just what 'immediately appears in the mind' and is in that sense 'immediate': then I gotta say, from the perspective of material reality, this immediacy is the most mediated thing imaginable (i.e. in order to have any kind of immediate thought or idea it actually has to be totally indexed, discovered, related to, explored, understood, rationalized, transported from sensory organs, imagined, etc. in the mind before it can be just a stupid immediate thought). In this sense I have difficulty treating the distinction between immediacy and mediation as an *easy* primary distinction where you can just say 'quality is immediate and so it can't be the determinate being of determinate being because that's a mediation'. Like, maybe the mediation of mediation is immediacy? Maybe determinate being is in some way immediate as well (section 191 seems to indicate that)

So given all that if determinate being is mediated, and quality is immediate, then the determinate being of determinate being would be the mediation of mediation which I don't think has be determinatively ruled out as immediacy?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> yes I think the relationship between them is very complicated.
§ 191
"From becoming there issues determinate being, which is the simple oneness of being and nothing. Because of this oneness it has the form of immediacy. Its mediation, becoming, lies behind it"

so determinate Being has the form of immediacy but its mediation lies behind it. I brought this up before because I wanted to know what the difference was between having something and having the form of something was.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think its like how we see ourselves as being just what we are in ourselves because were seeing it from the perspective of understanding, we dont see the way we are mediated externally.

Why do you suppose this is the case? Don't you first need to understand it on Hegel's terms in order to restate it? Otherwise you won't know what is being lost in your transformation. This is why we push back on you bringing in outside stuff or trying to twist it; we want to know that you understand it on its terms first. Once we understand it, we should be able to explain it, and get on the same page. Then we can debate its shortcomings and how to sublate it into a 'better' system.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> Immediate in SoL is logically immediate. Empty thought is both immediate and indeterminate because it is does not depend on any other thoughts to be derived logically, that is to appear clearly in our mind. 
Each other moment can be derived from only the thoughts before it and their immanent movement (something we should discuss further). But then each moment has its own Being, can be thought directly, held in the mind, *immediately*. its from this that its inner contradictions/deficiencies come out and it moves dialectically, eg developing other concepts to define it stably.

I am open to all your critiques as how this method may be flawed. I have thought a lot about whether this holds up with what we now know about the brain. Hegel of course believed in the divine soul, spirit. But ultimately, what we are talking about is simply self-awareness of thought; its like formalism of math without the symbols, instead, it has to be held clearly in your mind to check it. It is *not* supposed to depend on the nature of that mind, just on its capacity of three operations: Being, Negation, Becoming - Understanding, Doubt/Skepticism, and Speculation/Reason. 

I am still curious if you would elaborate why you hold so firm on the primacy of negation or contradction, rather than the simultaneous identity of being and negation.</p>

p228: "In the sphere of being, the self-determining even of the Notion is at first only in itself or implicit — as such it is called a transition; and the reflected determinations of being such as something and other, or finite and infinite, although they essentially refer to each other or are as a being-for-other, they too count as qualitative, as existing on their own account; the other is, the finite ranks equally with the infinite as an immediate, affirmative being, standing fast on its own account; the meaning of each appears to be complete even without its other"</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> No, you first need to restate Hegel's statement to understand it. The way you know what is lost in the transformation is when someone says 'hey you lost this in your transformation'.  

* Maybe the problem is that I don't post **THOMAS IS A FUCKUP** every time someone makes a good point that changes my mind (such as when Tom said that determinate being is different from becoming and I thought they weren't and then we read the chapter and I was like, oh yeah --- becoming is the externaml movement of the contradiction and determinate being is the internal point around which that movement occurs).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> "Immediate in SoL is logically immediate. Empty thought is both immediate and indeterminate because it is does not depend on any other thoughts to be derived logically, that is to appear clearly in our mind. "

Or course, empty thought is incredibly difficult to maintain meaning that in fact you have to mediate away other thoughts to get to empty thought.

This doesn't really answer the original question about quality as mediated mediation (and seems to work against it --- i.e. it seems to imply that every mediation is also an immediate in some way and thus saying something is immediate and thus not a mediation doesn't work as an argument). 

What I'm saying about restatement is (edit: *not*) contradicting this statement about notions being thinkable on their own: what's 'thinkable on its own' about the notion is the *structure* of the notion --- but to get to that structure (and to get it into your head) you have to give it the acid test of trying to apply it in multiple places: even if multiple places simply means in multiple places *within itself* --- and while Hegel has done some of that, he hasn't done all of that exploration because how could he? 

Also I would say that this isn't a pedagogical position that Hegel is taking I think... I think he's just saying here that these things are separable into themselves (like a separability clause in a contract, just because the judge throws out one clause doesn't mean the others all collapse).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> Yea I think I misspoke to some extent, immediate only takes it's logical not-mediated meaning for the first two, being/nothing, which I was responding to.
They are mediated by mental mechanisms, but not conceptually defined by them; they're empty, without definition or content; mediated by the mental mechanism of clearing away only. 

Other thoughts are logically mediated in that we come to them through their derivation.
Their immediacy is holding them in our minds.
Hegel uses this as the "acid test", ie, it's the *immediacy* of the finitude which spells it's contradiction and leads to the infinite. It's taking a magnifying class to the concept to find any problems. 
I think Hegel even implies somewhere that if it's incoherent, ie contradictory, it can't have being, its negated. 

Hegel's logical method has to be internal.
Pedagogically, examples are helpful. But they can't determine whether the concepts are True without a method, and that's what he is developing.
We might simply misunderstand the examples. We may be misinterpreting the science bcs of our own background assumptions.

Especially if we are trying to evaluate the Truth of the book, we have to understand it in conceptual fully and in its own terms first.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> No, examples can't determine truth. but in the end the method is also an example itself (in the sense that is the sui generis self-example). 

I'm okay with contradictory things not having being, contradictions also have consequences beyond their immediacy that give them being (i.e. there are non-contradictory aspects of contradictions, partial object which are partially contradictory and don't exist and partially consistent and do exist).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I am unhappy with my explanation of ought = limitation of limitation in the chat. 

There is a straightforward way to look at it which is that limitation is like a chasm and ought is like a bridge across the chasm and a bridge negates a chasm (by providing a path across it ---- the bridge being made out of 'not chasm stuff' that must be available in order for the chasm to act as a limitation to either side of the chasm: this necessarily available material is the contradiction of the limitation, the fact that the limitation say 'though shall not pass' and the rocks on either side of the chasm say 'build a bridge and pass anyway': thus there is a limit on limitation in the ought --- limitation cannot be a total limit, it must implicitly point to a beyond --- It is only in the infinite that this beyond will be turned back against itself and we will find 'there is no beyond' --- the beyond is a contradiction --- but for now...). However, this is not *enough* because  it only speaks to the *limit* of limitation. The limitation should also expand through an ought in the same way that the object negated in a particular limitation is expanded (i.e. the territory you can explore is expanded through the ought of the bridge) --- i.e. the fulfilling of the ought, ought to expand limitation if ought is to be the limitation of limitation.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Right now I think of it this way in exemplar form: we have a line that is between two points (say 0 and 1) and the limitation is contradictory because the very fact that we say 'this line is only between 0 and 1' implies that there are lines that could be longer or shorter: the limitation is a fake limit, a mere prohibition (whose truth is that its can be contradicted: i.e. you're blocked from going further and you are not so blocked). So we get the first ought which I feel is a kind of spurious ought where we just swap out one limitation for another --- now the line is between 0 and 2. Okay but in reality, the limitation is actually saying that a line is defined as opposed to a point (its not a point) and there ought to be some point which isn't on *any* line. This means it ought not be in any of the limits we might choose along this number line. That means it *has to be* (necessity) orthogonal to the number line (possibility, because there are many such points, not just one)  --- creating a plane. This is the true ought. 

But what happens here? We don't overcome the original limits --- in fact our line might still only be between 0 and 1 or 0 and 2, but instead in this true ought, we actually create a whole new type of object (the plane) and what's more we also introduce *more* limitations --- because now the line can't just be between two points, but instead it needs to be *the shortest distance between any two points* --- we've added a limitation, i.e. following this ought not only expanded the space of objects, it also expanded the space of limits. Thus this true ought is the limitation of limitation itself (i.e. there is a coincidental moment where the overcoming of the ought of a single object also overcomes the limitation of limitation itself, by, ironically, expanding limitation). 

But then the infinite comes in and starts tying these limitations off by self-relating the limitations (i.e. the line becomes its own terminal points in the circle).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The way I keep the system in my head is by focusing on the finite.
I don’t really need to think about the infinite as anything other than the opposite of the finite.

Once I understand how the finite ceases to be from moment to moment, I go back and examine its unity with the infinite.

It’s very hard for me to imagine two *concepts* at once, unless I use mental pictures or math.
And Hegel does talk about this issue in the text. He actually has a term for the infinite-that-we-don’t-really-care-about-yet, and that’s very helpful for me.

When he started the system with pure being, it was necessary for him to invent pure nothing so that he could have something to compare pure being with.
That necessary comparing of concepts *is* the system.  At least that’s how I understand it.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Given that Hegel starts with pure being, it seems to me that the infinite is intrinsic to the project. The book begins with Substance, that is the stuff that the whole of reality consists. 
Starting with the infinite or with the finite will set up the same dynamic I think, but it is the case that the finite emerges from deteriminate being first. That is because determiniate being is differentiated and thereby includes the negative. By being determined it is necessarily limited. 
I do not think Hegel invents pure nothing. Rather the negative has been a concern since the earliest days of Greek philosophy. It's certainly a problem presented in parmenides. Without a negative concept there cannot be multiplicity, movement, change, etc... And this is why Parmenides, who claimed that the negative was not, argued that the truth was one thing and that it was undifferentiated. 
In a Louis CK bit from years ago Louis CK's kid asks him "why?" until Louis is forced to answer the question on the most abstract basis possible. He's pushed into philosophy: 
"Why?" 
"Because some things are and some things are not!"
"Why?"
"Well, because things that are not can't be!" 
"Why?"
"Well, because then nothing wouldn't be. You can't have fucking 'nothing isn't. everything is.'" <---Parmenides
"Why?"
"Because if nothing wasn't there would be all kinds of shit that we don't want, like giant ants with top hats on dancing around."
"Why?" 
"Oh, fuck you! Eat your french fries you little shit!"

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> As for the ought as the negative of the limitation: 
Hegel says: "With respect to the form of the limitation and the ought, two prejudices can be criticised in more detail. First of all, great stress is laid on the limitations of thought, of reason, and so on, and it is asserted that the limitation cannot be transcended. To make such as assertion is to be unaware that the very fact that something is determined as a limitation implies that the limitation is already transcended. For a determinateness, a limit, is determined as a limitation only in opposition to its other in general, that is, in opposition to that which is free from the limitation; the other of a limitation is precisely the being beyond it. Stone and metal do not transcend their limitation because this is not a limitation for them."
Because the stone does not think, does not even feel, its limitedness is not a limitation for it, that is, is not a negation in it for sensation, imagination, thought, etc., which it does not possess. But even the stone, as a something, contains the distinction of its determination or in-itself and its determinate being, and to that extent it, too, transcends its limitation; the Notion which is implicit in it contains the identity of the stone with its other. If it is a base capable of being acted on by an acid, then it can be oxidised, and neutralised, and so on. In oxidation, neutralisation and so on, it overcomes its limitation of existing only as a base; it transcends it, and similarly the acid overcomes its limitation of being an acid. This ought, the obligation to transcend limitations, is present in both acid and caustic base in such a degree that it is only by force that they can be kept fixed as (waterless, that is, purely non-neutral) acid and caustic base."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> But it is reason, thought, which is supposed to be unable to transcend limitation — reason, which is the universal explicitly beyond particularity as such (that is, all particularity), which is nothing but the overcoming of limitation! Granted, not every instance of transcending and being beyond limitation is a genuine liberation from it, a veritable affirmation; even the ought itself, and abstraction in general, is in imperfect transcending. However, the reference to the wholly abstract universal is a sufficient reply to the equally abstract assertion that limitation cannot be transcended, or, again, even the reference to the infinite in general is a sufficient refutation of the assertion that the finite cannot be transcended.

So it is through thought and reason that the finite can fully sublate its own limitations and transform into the infinite without creating a beyond that is its other and that maintains the finite. This creation of the beyond and the holding onto the finite, the creation of an infinity of the finite, is a spurioius infinity as it is not a self-realized infinity where the unity of the finite and the infinite is apprehend in the notion.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Louis CK *ought* to have read the Science of Logic 😅 I feel like this is good training to be a parent in that specific respect.

Re-reading the development of the infinite last night, the key turn which stood out to me is this:

"§ 300

If, at first, the return into self was considered to be just as much a return of the finite to itself as return of the infinite to itself, this very result reveals an error which is connected with the one-sidedness just criticised: first the finite and then the infinite is taken as the starting point and it is only this that gives rise to two results. It is, however, a matter of complete indifference which is taken as the beginning; and thus the difference which occasioned the *double* result disappears of itself. 
... 
it is quite immaterial what point is fixed on or which of the two is taken as the beginning. 
...
 Since both the finite and the infinite itself are moments of the progress they are *jointly or in common the finite*, and since they are equally together negated in it and in the result, **this result as negation of the finitude of both is called with truth the infinite.**
 Their difference is thus the double meaning which both have. 

The finite has the double meaning of being first, only the finite *over against the* infinite which stands opposed to it, and secondly, of being the finite and at the same time the infinite opposed to it. 

The infinite, too, has the double meaning of being one of these two moments — as such it is the spurious infinite — and also the infinite in which both, the infinite and its other, are only moments. 
**The infinite**, therefore, as now before us **is**, in fact, **the process in which it is deposed to being only one of its determinations, the opposite of the finite,** and so to being itself only *one* of the finites, and **then raising this its difference from itself into the affirmation of itself and through this mediation becoming the true infinite.**""</p>

The significance of this being a *Becoming* only now really sank in for me.
What <@1144442476145426592> said about the necessity of comparing concepts for them to be stably defined:
 that Being and Nothing require each other for their meaning, and in the same way, now, Infinite and Finite taken separately only pass into each other.
But this passing into each other thereby forms the means to define them each, but only in reference.

This inter-determination is what makes it a Becoming, and not a self-stable existence.

Something is also a Becoming.
I only now really understand this myself.
Something has two determinations, abstract existence and negative reference to the Other.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Initially Something has no qualities to define it by except existence and distinction from the other. But it is itself an other, equally.
So something is merely the idea of a something distinct from an other; there's nothing distinguishing it.

By developing the being of Limit, the something and other are the define by that limit; and that definition is implied by their existence, so is intrinsic.
Finitude is the explicit quality of being determined by a limit.
So only now in Finitude, Something has an intrinsic Quality.
When the Limit becomes intrinsic to the Something, it's then called a Limitation.

The Ought is *not really* the limitation of limitation; only by taking the first loosely to mean 'negation' and then specifying precisely what is being negated in it.

The Ought is: "The in-itself ... As negative reference to itself as limitation"

What does that mean? 

The Limit was that which Something (and Other) were determined by; it took the place of each other as the negative self-reference.
Instead of "I am other of other" they became "I am what is not outside the limit". 
With finitude, the limit is internalized:
"I am what is not outside*my* limitation".

Here, limitation becomes the determination.
Quality was the existent determinateness / being of determinateness.
Limit was an in-itself, determination as an in-itself.
Here, Limitation is the determination of the finite; but no longer external determination. It is *internal* negative self reference.

But "internal" and "negative self reference" don't sit easily.
Something is now internally determined and therefore no longer a something, it *transcends itself*.

I think*ought* is the in-itself of the internal determination 
The negative self reference is negated</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> So I think that my point was that the view of ought as mere negation of limitation is not sufficient, but actually you have to take **limitation** of limitation seriously to get a true ought as not only the overcoming of a specific object but as the overcoming of limitation itself that is then back propagated to specific objects: the problem is that you can have a spurious ought to go with the spurious infinity (i.e. I ought to be able to extend the length of this line a line little bit more) as opposed to a true ought that would create actual objects. The first ought is a mere 'negation of limitation' --- it is an 'ought' in the same way that spurious infinite is 'an infinite' but it isn't the true ought. 

The line you're refrencing is from $254 I think? the full sentence is "This in-itself, therefore, as the negative relation to its limit (which is also distinguished from it), to itself as limitation, is the ought." The difficulty I have is that by the time we reach this sentence, limit and also limitation is already included in 'in-itself as negatively related to x' as one of its necessary moments I think (that is, a limitation is *also* an in-itself negatively related to something and to properly have an in-itself you must *also* include a limitation). So one way to read this would be 'This *limitation*, therefore, as the negative relation to its limit (which is also distinguished from it), to itself as limitation, is the ought.' Which can also be restated as 'This limitation, as the negative relation to itself as limitation is the ought' which I think can also be read as just 'the ought is the limitation of the limitation'.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I think he just establishes that limitation is an in-itself in that paragraph (he kind of rushes the establishment because I think one of his points is that you have to immediately specify further that the limitation is more specifically an ought and he doesn't want to leave us in the realm of limitation, but I think section 254 is where he does the double movement). But beyond that, my understanding is that once established as the in-itself its always the in-itself, now we're haggling over deeper specifications within limitation (if there are in-itself which are *not* limitation they would have to come before and be either determination or constitution as separate guys from each other within the 'in-itself').</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Re-reading the section on limit, it's never developed to be an in-itself.
Re-reading the part on limitation, he never establishes that.
They are qualities; limit is called "otherness" and non-being-for-other.

In-itself comes from something; he uses the term in-itself here bcs it's not really a something, because it's not determined by an external other or external limit.
He explains in the next paragraph something transcends itself because bcs the limit is sublated to be internal.

That's why, in the paragraph developing Limitation and Ought, he call it an in-itself; it's basically a something, but technically transcending that form.

Limitation cannot have a limitation because it would require 1) it to be an in-itself, but it's a quality, it exist in the thing it is a limitation of.
2) it would have to be finite, ie have an immanent limit. But an immanent limit requires immanent determinations; limitation is determined as for that which it a limitation of.

I mean, again, it just seems like you're clinging on to this "limitation of limitation" because you like the sound of it, without any attention to the text.

Idek what you're talking about with "overcoming specific objects" and "back propagation".

I really think it's important we try to understand the text in its own terms and try to understand the specific meanings of each one. 
How they are used in the text is extremely precise and based on their derivation. Pulling in our own associations of the words doesn't have a good track record so far</p>

"the ought is the transcending, but still only finite transcending, of the limitation. Therefore, it has its place and its validity in the sphere of finitude where it holds fast to being-in-itself in opposition to limitedness, declaring the former to be the regulative and essential factor relatively to what is null."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> "Re-reading the section on limit, it's never developed to be an in-itself."

Here we're talking about limitation (not limit, right?) --- I'm not talking about limit, I'm talking about what happens when non-being-for-other (limit) further becomes determinative of a particular object, not just an externality.

"In-itself comes from something; he uses the term in-itself here bcs it's not really a something, because it's not determined by an external other or external limit.
"  

I don't think this is correct at this point --- in multiple places he seems to indicate that the in-itself which is the meeting point (at this point) of constitution and determination has already taken on the property of being externally limited. 

"Determination and constitution showed themselves as sides for external reflection; but the former already contained otherness as belonging to the something's in-itself; the externality of the otherness is on the one hand in the something's own inwardness, on the other hand it remains, as externality, distinguished from it, it is still externality as such, but present in the something."

I don't see why a limitation isn't *also* a something (i.e. why the limitation isn't the in-itself of in-itself which is the something of something). Certainly by the time we start discussing limitation we have access to something --- it *could* be a something, there are somethings at this point (I'm not saying that means it is something for sure, just that we aren't here restricted from having these things).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I also notice that 'something' is the first negation of the negation while limit is outright defined as a negation of negation in 254 --- for me this isn't a problem (I think its negation of negation all the way down) but for Hegel this would seem to indicate that a limit is at least a something, so I don't know where that leaves limitation... 

Overall, my feeling is still that in 254 he doesn't like outright say 'the limitation is the in-itself of x' but I think that's heavily implied throughout the entire paragraph (and before that) --- really that the limit is the in-itself seen from outside (the meeting point of constitution and Determination) while the limitation is the in-itself posited as such.</p>

I think the next paragraph is just a reiteration and shortening of 254 --- I don't think this is a forward moving paragraph. It was already sublated to be internal in 254. 

"That's why, in the paragraph developing Limitation and Ought, he call it an in-itself; it's basically a something, but technically transcending that form."

I mean I would agree that ought is an in-itself, but also limitation (and also a something, ought is also a something --- an over-specified something). But that's because I think each of these things is conceptually contained in the other so that somethings are a kind quality, in-itself is a kind of something, limitation is a kind of in-itself, ought is a kind of limitation.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "Limitation cannot have a limitation because it would require 1) it to be an in-itself, but it's a quality, it exist in the thing it is a limitation of."

Okay I think he're we're getting into an interesting argument but I don't buy it: qualities can also be somethings --- its not the case that *all* qualities are something (because quality comes first, something is specified on quality) but I do think it is the case that all somethings are *also* qualities (of something else --- which I think is one of the points of the movements of limit and limitation, but also they are qualities of reality). So saying 'well its a quality' --- Are you saying limitation is a *pure* quality --- because that doesn't seem correct.

This is an even more interesting argument: "2) it would have to be finite, ie have an immanent limit. But an immanent limit requires immanent determinations; limitation is determined as for that which it a limitation of."

Hegel definitely says that the infinite starts with the ought (which comes ever so slightly after limitation) so I'm not convinced that its not finite immediately on that basis. But you have a deeper idea of finite in mind. So 'immanent determination' means the limitation has to have qualities --- which I'm okay with, I think its also a something so it has qualities.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> So I think the claim here is that limitation *doesn't* have qualities (or that a specific limitation doesn't have any quality to it, it is a quality but doesn't have a quality, unlike a something which I read as the quality of quality and thus flips around and becomes a quality with qualities).  And the reason why is that what would be called its 'qualities' are just the object its attached which it is a quality of, not which is a quality of it. Okay...

Except that it does have a quality of its own which is the ought: that is, it has these mediated determination in the object its a limitation of, sure, but it also has this immediate determination in the ought, in the fact that it can be overcome: this is not a quality of *the object* that the limitation is attached to but rather its a quality *of the limitation*. 

The fact that there is a place beyond the points at the end of the line is not a quality of the line but of the points as the limitation of the line (the argument for this being that *anything* could be in that space beyond, but that *anything* doesn't affect the line --- just the the fact that it only goes up to its limiting points affects the line: but the 'anything' does affect the points, if the anything touches them perfectly and brushes up against the line, then the points are not a limitation any longer because actually its the edge of this other thing which becomes the lines limitation --- or to put it another way, the immanent determination --- quality --- of a limitation is that it can be replaced by another limitation).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> "I mean, again, it just seems like you're clinging on to this "limitation of limitation" because you like the sound of it, without any attention to the text." 

Yes it can *sound* like that to you, it is poetic but that's not why I'm advancing this. I'm advancing this because I read the text, and this was the thought I got out of it. It may be wrong thought, I may not have read it correctly (I don't think so), but it is the thought I immanently felt while reading it. 

“Idek what you're talking about with "overcoming specific objects" and "back propagation".”

By ‘overcoming specific objects’ I mean to juxtapose the limitation of a single object vs. the category of all limitations. By ‘back propagation’ I mean that once you’ve determined something is true for a category it becomes true for everything in that category (it back propagates from the category to the specific objects).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> “I really think it's important we try to understand the text in its own terms and try to understand the specific meanings of each one.”

I agree

“How they are used in the text is extremely precise and based on their derivation.” 

That’s fine.

“Pulling in our own associations of the words doesn't have a good track record so far”

I strongly disagree, I think I’ve learned more from pulling in associations of the words than I  ever possibly could have just nodding my head in agreement and not really understanding but pretending I do so as to save myself the risk of not looking like a fool. The associations are going to be there regardless. That is not really negotiable. It is changeable, but only by stating them and dealing with them, but stating them and dealing with them is not *negotiable* if we are to actually be having a conversation. What we’re actually arguing over is whether I will state the associations or remain effectively silent (i.e. whether we will have a real conversation about this vs. me occasionally parroting you to not annoy you and otherwise shutting the fuck up). And I don’t do that, I may moderate tone but If I disagree the choice between ‘ah yes that’s very interesting but are we aware that...’ on one end of the spectrum and ‘that not true you idiot’ on the other (and silence as the third), but the choice isn’t ‘oh yeah, you’re right, definitely’ when I definitely don’t agree. You have to make me agree with you.  (I also think there is a strange desire not to deal with the human side of learning here: like the text should be understood on its own terms, but it has to be understood by a concrete human being, you're only  going to get them to understand the text on its own terms *in their own terms* simultaneously --- how's that for a unity of opposites).</p>

This isn’t a problem for me because to transcend an object is also to be the object (really to complete it) so It doesn’t really create a firm separation between ought and limitation. So unless Hegel says means the opposite by transcendence somewhere...</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> sorry not read all of everyones comments yet but just had the thought while i was reading (253) that there is a contradiction in **something** being **finite**, and conversly "that the finite is". (253) How can something be finite if it *is*? the definition of finite would imply that it should end but it carries on being, it exists infinitly right before our eyes, it doesnt end. If something is then it just is theres no end, otherwise instead of saying something **is** you'd always say it **is but will not be**. (this is but will not be a pencil)

Like I can look at this pencil and say if it is finite then let me see it end, when is it going to end its supposed to dissapear but it just carries on being and you cant sit there and watch a pencil til it just ceases to be. So its like youre supposed to be finite but you just keep staying there... and on and on 😄</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I don't disagree *pedagogically* with bringing in our associations; that feels like a slight of hand.
You were claiming "actually you have to take the ..." As though speaking *logically*.
I am claiming that you cannot *rely* on understanding of terms by associations. Our Intuitive sense of the terms *has to yield* to the technical determinations. 
That's pretty explicit in Hegels introductions. Rational critique has to form and shape our intuitions, not the other way around.

This only works if you are willing to experience the falsity of your intuitions and continue to in letting it attempt to try to grasp the meaning; being cut to size by critical reason, and continuing to try to grasp it more.

If you cling to your intuitions despite critical falsifications, you're not really learning anything.

For example, to say "really that the limit is the in-itself seen from the outside" is just to say you don't know what in-itself is. 
I'm just asking you to consider that.

"Seen from the outside" is for-other. In-itself is contrasted to the for-other.
The in-itself is there merely implicit, explicitly, it's only know as 'not other', negative self reference.
Limit becomes this "other" which something is *external* defined against, ie it's that which Something (and the other something ) are defined in negative self reference, their being-for-other determination.

Limit never develops an independent existence; it only exists as a moment for the something and other (which is a something).
I'm not saying it couldnt have become a something; idk, I previously thought it did. But Hegel doesn't say it does.
It *only* exists *for somethings*, hence, not an in-itself. If the somethings cease to exist, so would it. That's part of what it means to be a quality, it does not stand on its own.

So the passage on Ought, we *really do* have to dig through all the previous developments to understand what he means by *in-itself* in that context.
To know what is being negated and why</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> <@805731746384445460>, is there a connection between the super ego and the ought in Lacan? Because through Zizek I've gotten that the super ego is all about what you 'ought' to do and to the extent where the ought becomes an impossible demmand. I came to this by thinking about how sometime the ought is impossible, you ought not to have broken that and so on, sometimes the ought is fulfilled and sometimes it isnt, and it seems like the super ego is the ultimate nuerotic instance of this as its always telling you what you ought to do even when you can't.

Could very well be a superficial similarity but thought id throw it out there.

(§ 263) ""'You can, because you ought' — this expression, which is supposed to mean a great deal, is implied in the notion of ought. For the ought implies that one is superior to the limitation; in it the limit is sublated and the in-itself of the ought is thus an identical self-relation, and hence the abstraction of 'can'. But conversely, it is equally correct that: 'you cannot, just because you ought.' For in the ought, the limitation as limitation is equally implied; the said formalism of possibility has, in the limitation, a reality, a qualitative otherness opposed to it and the relation of each to the other is a contradiction, and thus a 'cannot', or rather an impossibility.""</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> right, I always assumed that this is the source of morality and ethics, but in lacan he points out that it has taken a negative turn in current society anxd becomes endless beating yourself up.

Actually I think thats wrong, the beating yourself up was in Freud actually, for enjoying yourself too much maybe, but in Lacan it became beating yourself up for 'not' enjoying yourself, or at least in Zizeks Lacan.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Fromm's book Man For Himself is truly remarkable!
Clear Hegelian reference, and is basically about developing a healthy super ego, or conscience.
One which is internalized, and refined by self reflection, not external pressures.
Because the super ego begins in childhood as internalization of parents voices; and many people never uproot it to question it but live by the implicit values they grew up with.
So he shows how to develop a real Ethic from a materialist understanding of our sense of ethics</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Yea - I mean behavior to me is v idiosyncratic. It's the underlying structures of the psyche one can know about, and you have to get to know people to make sense of them from that angle</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think one goal of therapy would be *not* to look at anyone as the one who knows.
I agree w that part of what Thomas was saying.
I definitely don't want anyone to passively agree with me</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> "This only works if you are willing to experience the falsity of your intuitions and continue to in letting it attempt to try to grasp the meaning; being cut to size by critical reason, and continuing to try to grasp it more."

I'm trying to get there, not yet there --- I mean I do allow this to happen: I just have a very high bar for its occurrence (you really have to convince me that I'm plain wrong as opposed to 'well I didn't have that feeling when I read it' Which is very like 'cool, whatever'). (there isn't really a disagreement on the primacy of the text, rather the disagreement is on whether the text says what you think it says vs. it saying what I think it says vs. and this is a radical possibility --- it being ambiguous between the two of us). 

"Seen from the outside" is for-other. In-itself is contrasted to the for-other."
I've considered it and that was not my reading (and I don’t think this is ambiguous, but you can consider my evidence and see if you agree). 

Its contrasted *and* unified with the for-other. The something splits into the for-other and the in-itself *and then* the in-itself is further determined into the determination (the for-other of the in-itself) while the for-other is further determined into constitution (the in-itself of the for-other). This means that the in-itself obtains an aspect of the for-other in its determination (this is in section § 231). (which isn't *just* for-other, it's specifically the for-other of the in-itself).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I think the most interesting argument you've made here is: "Limit never develops an independent existence; it only exists as a moment for the something and other (which is a something)." 

First I want to insist again: we aren't talking about limit but limitations, because I think it may be an important difference. But I also think I did specifically say it seems very likely that limit is something so this is a fair question. 

But is a limit something then using this criteria? I actually think that is: because the limit is determined outside both something and its other it has to be something itself independent of both of them (the mountains between eastern and western washington are mountains whether or not eastern and western washington are the territories on either side). This could be extended by thinking of a situation where the limit is instead a desert or a river (i.e. it obtains an independent existence because it matters *how* something and other make contact with each other through the limit for us to decide which limit, exactly, we’re talking about). I think this reasoning is enough to defeat the question for the purposes of *my argument* (i.e. I think a limit does exist independently as a third in the formula of something and other --- its the ‘and’ which has its own substantive existence). The fact that he says a point is a limit in section 246 (and we know he thinks a point is also a something --- actually he calls lots of ‘somethings’ ‘limits in that section) makes me think that a limit is also a something in this way.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> But then the question would become --- okay maybe a limit is a something, even a something necessarily... but it isn’t a *limit* without both something and the other. This is where I would move to *limitation* as the in-itself of the in-itself as opposed to limit because limit may always be a something but may not carry the valence of something into its quality as a limit while limitation may not be burdened with that deficiency: by this I mean precisely in the move of internalizing the limit into the object through limitation the direction of causality flips --- its not that limitation doesn’t exist without the something its assigned to, but rather the something its assigned to doesn’t exist without the limitation (my evidence is this sentence from 254: Something's own limit thus posited by it as a negative *which is at the same time essential*, is not merely limit as such, but limitation) This essentialness would seem to flip the direction of necessity on its head in terms of what requires what to exist.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> "So the passage on Ought, we really do have to dig through all the previous developments to understand what he means by in-itself in that context." I don't disagree (If you remember, the conceptual break I was talking about was between the infinite and the finite --- I was annoyed at tom for stepping into the middle of a conversation about the infinite with a demand that I explain the whole of the finite in a single go to him to prove to him that I'm  not an asshole and bullshitter. Even in the form of **our** disagreement --- ought = limitation of limitation, limitation = in-itself of in-itself, etc. each step I propose still relies upon all the previous steps. To really get the ought in my understanding you would need to dig through all the aspects of limitation which would entail all the aspects of in-itself which would entail... etc. which is why this statement has triggered such a total exploration of the text which is why it's a good question: if it was a bad question it would be very easy to answer).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> I just don't buy that any argument by example can determine whether a limit *in this development* is a something.
Any example changes Everything, it makes everything a something.
It loses the important abstractness of the text.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> All these give a strong sense that limit is merely a quality of the somethign and other; could not exist indepent of them. If there's anything to suggest otherwise, I'd consider it, but i've re-read it many times now and find no indication.

I have no clue how the limit becoming "immantment" would change that. The limitation is simply "Something's own limit thus posited by it as a negative which is at the same time essential"</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> But abstractions are also examples, they're just examples paired down to the essential thing (at least in my understanding). An example is good for establishing some things --- its good for establishing existence (so there are definitely limits that exist that are also somethings --- that is clear). And its good for establishing negation of existence (if you could provide me with an example of a limit which is *not* a something that would counter my position by establishing that limits aren't contained in the category of something). 

But if we really want to start with the beginning of limit~~ation~~ as a substantive object --- we should perhaps look at 239 where Hegel says:

"There is a single determinateness of both, which on the one hand is **identical with the being-within-self of the somethings** (thomas here: identical with their somethingness as far as I can tell --- that is from section § 209) as negation of the negation, and on the other hand, since these negations are opposed to one another as other somethings, conjoins and equally disjoins them through their own nature, each negating the other: this determinateness is limit."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "Its contrasted *and* unified with the for-other. The something splits into the for-other and the in-itself *and then* the in-itself is further determined into the determination (the for-other of the in-itself) while the for-other is further determined into constitution (the in-itself of the for-other). This means that the in-itself obtains an aspect of the for-other in its determination (this is in section § 231). (which isn't *just* for-other, it's specifically the for-other of the in-itself)."

The something is *both* in-itself and for-other; they are the two determinations of it; the 'in-itself' is the unique one, the determination that comes to exist only with the concept of the something:

"§ 220
Determinate being as such is immediate, without relation to an other; or, it is in the determination of being; but as including within itself non-being, it is determinate being, being negated within itself, and then in the first instance an other-but since at the same time it also preserves itself in its negation, it is only a being-for-other.
§ 221
It preserves itself in the negative of its determinate being and is being, but not being in general, but as self-related in opposition to its relation to other, as self-equal in opposition to its inequality. Such a being is being-in-itself."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> That Hegel says 'this determinateness which is identical with the being-within-self of the something (this determinateness which is identical with the somethingness of the somethings) ...: this determinateness is the limit. 

That's how I'm reading it (the stuff about negation of negation is interesting but it reinforces the point since something is the first negation of negation, the each negating each other is also interesting but I think its to the side of our current argument).</p>

Look at the following paragraph, first sentence:

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think what is negated in the second negation can't be described by that formula. Its negating the "one-sideness" of mere quality.
The Quality of Quality, is that quality is simply some aspect *of* quality, perhaps its abstractness, its "deficiency". That it is "only immediate".

Something is "negation of the negation"; negation is defined in the section on quality: "Nothing, as thus the determinate element of a determinateness, is equally something reflected, a negation."

Negation is a "determinate element" of quality/determinateness. So that suggests to my, only if you squint and conflate Quality with an element of it, can you say Something is Quality of Quality.

Quality, perhaps is negation 'in the form of being'; conent is negation, form is being.
For something, the *content* is being; thats what I take to be have "in itelf"; But it is only outwardly distinguished as not other; its form is negation</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> So here we're making progress and I can see how I could have shortened this whole argument up and was wrong myself (I kept thinking of *negation* as being synonymous with *nothing*) So we both get to be a little wrong here (your wrong because the squinting is a valid move). 

Insomuch as negation is a quality (and hegel says that negation is quality burdened with nothing) then something --- which is defined as negation of negation, necessarily is also a quality of quality.  But I like this because it makes me have thoughts which may develop into new concepts rather than running around in a circles through the text. 

I don't think however that they are siblings --- maybe quality is the *grandparent* or *great grandparent* or *aunt* of something (i.e. negation is the quality of quality or negation is the quality of nothing), but I definitely don't buy the sibling (or we could even say cousin) hypothesis: I think this step actually shows that something must flow from quality through negation which is a quality. 

My suspicion is that my original point about Hegel starting with being may continue to hold here --- that effectively quality burdened with nothing would be just quality (negation would be just quality) if Hegel wasn't an idealist and that in fact Hegel is adding steps to suit his idealism. But this is my spontaneous thought --- I'm not convinced by it yet (the other possibility I would hold out is that it goes quality of quality -> reality of reality -> negation of negation -> something, but this is also spontaneous and not a firm thought).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I am hesitant to say Negation is a Quality, as though negation does not precede it.
He does use 'negation' in moments of becoming, but as "abstract, immediate negation".
Also, v interesting at the end of the section on Quality:
"Negation taken as mere deficiency would be equivalent to nothing; but it is a determinate being, a quality, only determined with a non-being."

I think negation *becomes* a quality.
So in that sense maybe Something derives from Quality.

Tbh, I don't have a good intuition of *how* something is a negotiation of negotiation, like which negation is being negated? The emptiness of pure being? Or of Quality?

But coming back to limit, do you see why he calls it a "non-being-for-other"?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> § 208

In determinate being its determinateness has been distinguished as quality; in quality as determinately present, **there is distinction — of reality and negation.** Now although these distinctions are present in determinate being, they are no less equally void and sublated. Reality itself contains negation, is determinate being, not indeterminate, abstract being. Similarly, negation is determinate being, not the supposedly abstract nothing but posited here as it is in itself, as affirmatively present [als seiend], belonging to the sphere of determinate being. Thus quality is completely unseparated from determinate being, which is simply determinate, qualitative being.

§ 209

This sublating of **the distinction** is more than a mere taking back and external omission of it again, or than a simple return to the simple beginning, to determinate being as such. The distinction cannot be omitted, for it is. What is, therefore, in fact present is determinate being in general, distinction in it, and sublation of this distinction; determinate being, not as devoid of distinction as at first, but as again equal to itself through sublation of the distinction, the simple oneness of determinate being resulting from this sublation. This sublatedness of the distinction is determinate being's own determinateness; it is thus being-within-self: determinate being is a determinate being, a something.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Well, I think determinate being here is marked as a something --- and what is more the phrase negation of negation is truth of Hegel in some sense because I actually doesn't fit exactly what he says here: by which I mean that one way to look at this would be: quality splits into reality and negation, however the two come back together (as in becoming) and this co-equal coming back together of reality and negation produces a new determinate being that is both simply the token 'determinate being' but now also because it sublates two sub components (negation and reality) there is something for it to determine *against* and as a result it is also a something (the whole category of determinate being is a something now).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I'm thinking quality->reality->negation->somthing is more likely true (i.e. that the reality of reality is negation: I know this is a poetry, but there definitely is a bias against reality if you really read this last sentence of 197 very closely:

"Quality, taken in the distinct character of being, is reality; as burdened with a negative it is negation in general, likewise a quality but one which counts as a deficiency, and which further on is determined as limit, limitation."

--- it's not quality 'in general' which moves onto limit and limitation but specifically negation in general which moves on to limit and limitation --- passing by way of something. To me, I think Hegel is starting to smuggle materialism into his idealism here. 

Must still consider however.</p>

Why not 
Quality is being of nothing

Negation the nothing of quality

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Because I think what is going on here is we're moving from the most abstract concept to the most abstract concept as a series of necessary steps and the most abstract concept at each stage is the jumping off point for developing anything new so the only thing left to it is for it to apply itself to itself to generate something new (i.e. to sublate itself) --- I'm treating all of these steps as being prototyped on sublation (at least I think this what happens when its time for us to see a true new concept --- as opposed to something which is just an assemblage). This has to do with my understanding of contradiction, that you don't get anything interesting until you have a contradiction (which is always a self-contradiction eventually).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I'm not *completely* opposed to the idea that there could be an equal splitting in one of these objects --- especially because of non-relation (maybe the contradiction is such that it has to appear in multiplicity of distinct non-reducible paths)... but that wouldn't get us out of the x of x problem --- it would just say that there are two or more distinct 'x of x' that aren't equal to each other: which I'm not opposed. However, tbh I was originally reading reality and negation as coequal but looking at them now I don't think they are and I actually think that since we haven't yet hit non-relation that its like everything up til the one has this singular deterministic path for the moment.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I don't think every moment is a negation. 
There's an alternation of Beings and Negations, with becomings thrown in.
Ought, I'm not sure what it is, may Ought is both a quality and a Being? He does say it *is* and *is not*.

But Quality is a negation; something is a being, limit a negation, finite thing (being), limitation (neg), finitude (neg), infinite (being)

I am curious why you believe that only contradictions are interesting?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I would say that for Hegel clearly the moments before negation are not negation (or at least we can quibble over that and I don't particularly want to) --- however almost all of them (except being itself) have a flavor of negation since they all contain nothing somehow (and I believe that being without nothing doesn't exist, its not a concept, thing, idea, possibility, etc. in fact it is a contradiction). 

However after negation I think he gets into a groove where everything that is coming up is some kind of negation from that point forward (even the whole category of determinate being is a negation because it is a negation of negation because it is a something). 

To me 'being' is just 'not not' and becoming is 'not and not not' So even if there are becomings and beings thrown in... they're nothings first (this is not hegel's position). But even ignoring what I think, ought is definitely a something so even if its a quality its a quality which has negated itself into something. 

This is why I claim Hegel should start with nothing --- because the 'not' is what is doing all the work. 

"something is a being, limit a negation, finite thing (being), limitation (neg), finitude (neg), infinite (being)" --- I mean the opposition isn't between being and negation but between being and nothing, but they're all determinate being so they're all nothing as well as being and they are all (except quality perhaps) negations (because he doesn't build something out of reality without negation, he shoves negation into reality right quick). 

I think that only contradictions are 'interesting' because a system without contradictions is an automation. Its basically just pure being (the being without nothing that doesn't exist: i.e. its not really possible to not have a system without contradictions, but an automation is as close as we could imagine) --- Its death without death. Boring. 

The only point where there is choice, let alone freedom, is once there is a contradiction.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> My retelling of chapter 1 would be: Nothing (false) -> being (true or false --- because false false is true so we have either true or false available to us) -> becoming (true --- because tautology allows us to start swapping things out for other things, so tautology applied to tautology can swap tautology out for mere truth of becoming) -> determinate being (T and F) because the truth of truth is that it is *not* equal to tautology, is other than tautology, and as a result we get T != (T or F), the move from being to becoming can not be reverse stepped, we get a contradiction -> determinateness (F again, higher level)  contradiction of contradiction: that which is both a contradiction and not a contradiction --- determinatenesses are contradictions because they establish difference (this and that cannot be the same) but they are not contradictions because they exist (are determinate *being*).</p>

I think there's both beauty and the sublime (which does not mean unknowable) in the unity of Pure Being and Nothing.

They're not even really opposed on their purity. Idk if it is a contradiction or not. But I don't find any aesthetic problem with it.

I agree with every movement is centered on a negation. But what is being negated? There has to be being to negating.
Being is doing all the work of there being anything to work with, to be negated.

I think that's why Nothing is not quite negation; pure negation wouldn't even be negation, it'd return to nothing. Negation requires a being to negate. Negation requires being, and one negation makes contact with it, it becomes det being, DaSein.

So negation isn't a stand alone thing; and I think the same is for contradiction. Contradiction requires beings in contradiction.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Well I think the development coming out of something/other doesn't depend on which one is which.
So the development is immanent.
He's emphasizing precisely the abstractness of both, only having that they both exist and are distinct from each other. That's all we know about them.
He could write it as "the two somethings, mutually each's other" but he does need to analyze one at a time, to move through their individual determinations. But everything that applies to one, does also to the other, bcs they're only distinct .

He trying to emphasize the relativeness of "other"-ness. Other -ness is *not* immanent</p>

No. You asked why contradictions are 'interesting' not why they're 'true': They're 'true' because they're generative and you only need the single concept (the only nothing which demands the existence of something is a contradiction) to bootstrap yourself. Hegel needs two concepts to bootstrap himself (being *and* nothing). This is because of his idealism. The materialist response (by way of Occam's razor) is that this is one concept too many ("one becomes two"). 

"I agree with every movement is centered on a negation. But what is being negated? There has to be being to negating."

This is the disagreement between idealism and materialism at a deep level --- for materialism **there is no** being (and it doesn't have to be negated, the deepest concept is nothing negating itself --- or really nothing nothinging itself --- which is being which is contradiction --- its still nothing/not which is doing all the work: being is only doing like 99% of the work, in so much as it is 'not nothing' --- its really the 'not' which is doing the work). 

Contradiction doesn't require 'beings in contradiction' --- that's just what the appearance of contradiction must be within being --- actual contradiction is before everything else including being (its also after everything else -> its the mediated immediate). 

I don't think the pure 'not' has being, however I think it may not actually be nothing because its actually less than nothing (Here I'm bringing in Zizek). I.e. really it should be Nothing (contradiction)-> less than nothing (F) -> Being (T or F) -> Becoming (T) -> Determinate Being (contradiction again).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> What does 'Being' mean to you such that to claim: "the pure 'not' has [doesn't] have being?"

What is it that it doesn't have? 

Pure not is, but does not have being?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0@dve.h_37844#0</span> Pure not is, but does not have being?

Actually the pure not is not (both at the level of 'haha language is fun' but like really it doesn't have being, its not --- there is a name for that 'not,' the token/symbol --- but that also isn't the pure not, that's many contradictory twists and turns through being in by the time we get to the token). The pure not inside of every 'not' is the way in which something doesn't exist (at least once we're talking about objects). This is why its also the carrier of possibility: because possibility is first a non-being (pure possibility is first a non-being, it is only when it turns against itself that we start to get actual possibilities, after we've already stepped into being --- so determinateness or quality maybe is the first place where actual as opposed to pure possibility enters).  

Like the base note of the contradiction the pure nothing that ex-sists (here ex-sists means, something like 'fails to exist') before the pure not, is all that stuff which is actually impossible in the purest sense and couldn't ever happen: these things do not have being (or to put it another way, nothing == contradiction and contradiction == nothing: it's not just that contradictions don't exist but rather everything that isn't a contradiction exists and that's why I brought up the many world's hypothesis of quantum mechanics: here I'm not really stepping away from Hegel (except for the quantum mechanics bit): he also thinks things 'exist' if they are consistent --- Zizek's point about Hegel is that Marxists don't understand that Hegel is *almost* materialist in his idealism, and so most of what he says holds, that might be my disagreement with <@1144442476145426592>, not certain: there is more materialism to the Infinite that appears at first, it isn't all just fluff and stuff about God).</p>

Before that a != not not a (this was the difficulty I had with Alex when he was mad at me for saying that an orange is not not an apple: this is true because a cat is not an apple and an orange is not a cat: this kind of sophistic logic is the pure not working itself out in being).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> To me, Logic requires a desire for Truth, what I name Integrity.

Sophistry is a disregard for Truth, dishonesty, opportunitism, manipulation, deceit.
Its why you have lost credibility with many in the group; you *seem* more interested in looking clever than getting to the truth of the matter.

When you have an interest other than truth, but pretend to seem interested in the truth instrumentally for that other purpose, that's sophistry, imo.

Logic exists for the purpose of overcoming our self-deceptions, over coming our sophistry.

Do you have any basis to claim this nonsense is prior to being?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> "Do you have any basis to claim this nonsense is prior to being?" 

Not from Hegel, From Zizek yes but my personal basis rather is just that contradictions don't exist, they ex-sist (can't exist), and as a result they are not part of being. And I think its interesting that physics seems to indicate that everything that can exist does. So... they aren't a beyond, but rather they're the foundation upon which being exists (actually exists). 

The "true is a moment of the false." --- I think you're avoiding saying that Sophistry is *not* logic because you know what the implication of that is (therefore sophistry is the limit of logic, sophistry is a limitation on logic, logic ought to be sophistry). What I would say is that logic is the sophistry of sophistry --- the deception of the deceiver, and since the highest form of deception is self-deception it is specifically the deception of self-deception (i.e. its playing with meaningless symbols in their abstract movements --- deception, what you've called 'formalism' --- in the attempt to break ourselves of our self-deceptions because we can't *directly* escape our self-deception --- or to put it another way, Hegel is very careful in section $175 about saying that dialectic is *not* sophistry and my point is that 'yes its *not* sophistry, because its the negation of sophistry, its the sophistry of sophistry'. The reason *why* he feels the need to say this, though, is because that is the prime accusation against Hegel --- that what he's doing is *merely* nonsense and I'm saying I agree with Hegel I agree with Hegel that isn't *merely* doing nonsense, that like most adverbs that word is doing more work in that sentence that it should and that in reality Hegel is exploring the *implication of nonsense* for everything --- i.e. how do we *actually* escape sophistry).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I think that the use of the word desire is very important in what you said because one of the basic self-deceptions is the fantasy that *we* are the one serving truth. I should be clear, fantasies are sometime true so I'm not saying that anyone who thinks this is definitely wrong (or definitely wrong all the time), but rather that the fantasmic energy around this desire of truth leads us into error. The desire for truth is not, and cannot be the way to the truth (after all desire is the desire of desire --- desire desires nothing so much but to continue to be desire, i.e. to remain unfulfilled).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I would not define the desire for truth as integrity --- I think these are different things (specifically I think integrity is the drive towards truth which is not a desire in the sense that drive transcends desire). 

"Its why you have lost credibility with many in the group; you seem more interested in looking clever than getting to the truth of the matter." 

Yeah this is like the 'socialism is just equality' petit-bourgois type socialism that thinks that looking clever or achieving something great is just useless nonsense of the intelligentsia and not the inner core of the greatness of the intelligentsia which would have to be a part of any communism worth having. Even if *all* I care about is looking clever (and its not all I care about: what I care about if you really want to know is not suffering horrible death and I think that lies are a good way to suffer horrible death, and I also care about us getting these ideas right, not just repeating old stupid cliches and nostrums which have gotten us into this bad state to begin with, but that's neither here nor there) looking clever is still productive *by itself* --- it isn't something to be squashed except in the most extreme case (extreme here meaning like, putting peoples lives in immanent direct harm during an emergency and even then, I suspect the tendency). It has forced all of you to be on your best game and not treat this as just another reading group. 

"Zizek is also a sophist, and not a materialist."

As to the last point, why not both? The best logician of materialism will be the best sophist because they will be the best at deceiving us out of our self-deception. If the accusation is that Zizek is *merely* a sophist --- then yeah *that's* some nonsense.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think Zizek is sincerely interested in philosophy, although I don't think he's that great; his politics are very compromised imo. 
I don't think there were many good philosophers in his whole generation; I think he and Willam Jameson are closest to what I wish was there.
But the conviction of philosophy is historically not so big since WW2, imo. But declining since Hegel's time.
In part for good reasons. But also, imo, a lot of technologism & scientism.

I think truth has to be humanistic, not formal. I think that's the rational kernal of idealism; the truth is in always at least partly subjective, in the sense of my/our relation to it.
Pure subjective truths like philosophy, in some sense are more able to step outside History. Whereas any practical truth is contextualized by historically specific human practices, programming, engineering, therapy, politics, pedagogy, publishing, etc..
But philosophy is still a human practice. And what desires take us to it affect how we interact with it.
Isn't that what Zizek means about the master signifier as the 4th moment? The subjective, orienting, driving force?

Hegel says little things about overcoming finite desires, implying desiring ideals instead. 
This is really a difficult task, psychoanalysis has shown. I think religions have taken it seriously forever; and Hegel knew much more about all that than anyone since.
It's simply the default now to be in self deception. Quite an achievement of inner work to overcome. Maybe not historically even possible. Maybe it never was and all this is naive.
But it requires self knowledge, ultimately, and Reason to unwind it all.
A constant self questioning; Kierkegaard and Nietzsche are v good on this. As is Freud. idk Lacan but I understand he's taken to be doing that type of analysis.
Zizek understands it, to play the game. But he's also much more influenced by post structuralism and all that sophistry. Philosophy became a celebrity thing, and he is definitely into that.</p>

Engels thought Marxism was much more scientific than Zizek…not sure where he got that idea from.</p>

I think that Zizek is a very good philosopher though not the most careful scholar (the two are not exactly the same thing). I would agree that his politics are not completely my own but I always pay careful attention to the reasons why he says something, not just the headline (because usually the headline is a provocation).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> "I think truth has to be humanistic, not formal." 

No. The truth is the formalism of formalism (in that sense it is ‘not formal’ since formal is also a negation, but this ‘not’ doesn’t take us to ‘more human’ --- if anything it takes us towards something more like ‘more alien’). To me that is the whole point of this book we're reading. The truth *can't* be simply humanistic (i.e. you can't oppose humanism to the formalism of the truth). The truth may not be *merely* formal (in fact it isn’t) but it is formally formal (i.e. it must be formal or it doesn’t work, if it isn’t formal it isn’t truth). 

You don’t get to just free yourself of formalism arbitrarily (which I don't think you think, but you haven't given me a good rubric for when to drop formalism), but also the formality of it demands you work through contradictions if you are really driving towards truth and at some point your system will ‘break’ on those contradictions at which point the formalism breaks down and you have reinvent it anew with new assumptions. Assumptions are okay for first passes but the assumption is always founded on a contradiction: the contradiction that everything must be justified and the assumption doesn’t have to be justified --- that’s how I take Hegel’s specific statement in $175 --- i.e. “For sophistry is an argument proceeding from a baseless presupposition which is *uncritically* and *unthinkingly* adopted” (aside, this is also speculative reason without the return to reason that occurs in finding out your speculation was either right or wrong) --- the problem isn’t that you adopted an argument or even that you adopted it baselessly but rather that you did so unthinkingly and uncritically, i.e. without the ability to consider your assumption as an assumption (which means as a contradiction). This is the whole critique of formalism and Spinoza which I don’t read as a pure ‘formalism bad’ (which you seem to read it as) but rather ‘informal formalism bad’.</p>

To make this the rational kernel of idealism is to make it materialist but to make it materialist isn’t to say something like ‘my relation to the truth is the story I tell myself about it, your relation to the truth is your story about it, we all have our separate stories and they don’t have to be made consistent with each other’ --- that may be true but it isn’t The Truth. However, if I read this as an actually materialist claim then what you're saying here is a basic naive materialism (i.e. one way to put it would that materialism is the speed of light --- causality/truth is not predetermined but moves only at the speed of light, only at the speed of time --- the truth is that you don't know the truth until you encounter it, etc.) But this is not a *human* thing (its not epistemological but rather ontological). You don't know the truth until you encounter it because the atoms in your body literally don't ‘know’ their truth's until they encounter them. This is an aspect of the truth itself (it's in things themselves). Which is why I mention the speed of light/atoms. However, you would need to pick a side on this for me to know what you mean.</p>

There is a use of the word ‘subjective’ here that I think is both understandable but strange: I feel like if philosophy can step outside history then that would make it actually objective while if these others are bound to human history then they’re actually subjective, but I also know that there is likely a flipping of meaning (drawn from German idealism) that is occurring here between idealism and materialism. But this is suspect to me (especially since I suspect that German idealist subjectivism may be conflated with more modern uses of the term).</p>

Sure. 

“Isn't that what Zizek means about the master signifier as the 4th moment? The subjective, orienting, driving force?”

I’m not certain which work that is in but if you send it to me I’d like to read it. However, when it comes to the master signifier --- my understanding is that the truth of the drive is not the master signifier, but rather petit objet a (the unbearable gap of possibility which remains even if the master signifier is overwritten).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> ”That's just a formalistic understanding of Truth” 

That’s kind of my point --- that what you call formalism *is* desire for truth: so we have to get even more specific about the interconnection between sophistry and logic than simply relying on this spontaneous naive response. Its not *bad* as a spontaneous naive response (i.e. there are far worse) but its not anywhere near complete and it definitely isn’t up to the task of understanding Hegel.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "" to make it materialist isn’t to say something like ‘my relation to the truth is the story I tell myself about it, your relation to the truth is your story about it, we all have our separate stories and they don’t have to be made consistent with each other’ --- that may be true but it isn’t The Truth. ""

I mean here you making truth a passive, contemplative truth.

Marx's quote above, the whole thing on These on Feuerbach is that truth is a human practice.
Even Ontology and Epistemology, we have to realize we are human engaged in intellectual practices, with a history, often in textual medium, etc..
That these truths only have a human significance.
That's the materialist meaning of subjectivity, not arbitrary idiosyncrasies, like "story I tell myself"


The rational kernal of idealism is to have our own psyche/mind in order, that their are truths in our heads; we may come to know them through communication and practical experience, but they're not *about* the outer world, they're inner.
Ie logic.

But still, the standard we hold them too has to be a reference to our practical existence, not mere formal rules.
That's the problem w the Doctor example. The truth is about whether he actually *has cancer*, not an answer which technically avoids being incorrect.

That's the difference of formal/abstract truth vs contet/concrete truth</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@dve.h_37844#0</span> I'm not completely certain which part of this statement you're responding to: but if you mean that the infinite interpreted as material is just dialectical materialism I would agree? But you seemed somewhat hostile to the idea of the infinite in the live-stream. 

Zizek also has the various absurdities of the Soviet Union as part of his life history (and his understanding of what Marxism has actually been), and his critique of the Trotskyist understanding of the soviet union is that even if all the usual Trotskyist points hold about it being a counter revolution due to the failure of global world revolution the *nature* of the failure is *still* not well understood by Trotskyism because Trotskyism doesn't understand its *own* relation to this counter-revolution (this fact is an attempt to reject or repress something of our own fantasy by rejecting the counter revolution as a consequence of our revolution). Its still *our* counter revolution, i.e. an always-existing inherent potential consequence of *our* project including also the anti-scientific nonsense of the soviet union necessitated due to its self-justification through scientism (i.e. the fact that bureaucrats were formally justified to be in power due to their superior understanding of the scientific needs of the proletarian revolution --- the constant need for a 'correct line' for example --- however this very scientism lead to the need for the bureacratic chaos, the purges, the paranoia, the show trials, etc. as the *form* of counter revolution --- as opposed to a fascist counter revolution which takes the form of a civil war and death squads and death camps with no need for a trial where those killed simply do not participate in the symbolic order in the way they not only *do* participate in Stalinism, but where what's more the symbolic order turns against everyone --- specifically the bureacratic paranoia is an important symptom here).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> "I mean here you making truth a passive, contemplative truth."

I don't think the contradiction is contemplative. I do think that contemplation is fairly human so when I say its something more 'alien' I'm actually saying its not contemplative insomuch as the contemplative is human. All the 'we have to realize we are human engaged in intellectual practices, with a history, often in textual medium, etc.' --- that's fine but the moment you say 'That these truths only have a human significance.' --- the word *only* is doing a lot of work, way too much work, in fact it needs to go on strike... 

And if we *carefully* read Thesis 1  and thesis 2 --- Marx's claim here isn't 'there is only sensuous human activity and contemplation is nonsense' --- just that you can't stop at the contemplative or rather that the sensuous and human is a *necessary* (but there is no claim of *sufficiency*) aspect of materialism (i.e. you can't prove truth by thinking it into place: and btw, even with contradiction as I've proposed it this not something I've just theoried into place, its a constant rough encounter with contradiction through what is hopefully no more than half a natural lifetime --- empirical encounter in the realms of math, logic, philosophy, politics, biology, physics, etc. --- that has lead me to this point where the end becomes the beginning in contradiction. When I give you the reason for why contradictions are 'true': that's claim is meant to be read as a dialectical union of the empirical and tautological --- not just tautological). For the truth to be a humanism --- humanism would have to be sufficient for truth (and of course then the question would be 'what's the point of theory or Marx's whole project at all, he could just write the first thesis and be done with it: practice alone will save us). And what's more if we continue to read thesis 2 if anything that isn't about humanity, that's about the alien character of the truth from humanity.</p>

If here you’re saying that there is no necessary relation between what is in my head and the outside world (other, perhaps, than than the obvious naive one that the thoughts in my head are somehow encoded as actual material neural networks) then this is fine. Sure. 

“Ie logic.”

No necessary relation also means no necessary lack of relation. But I hold contradiction as the base due to the happy coincidence of self-reflective empirical reasons and tautological beauty, as stated --- not just merely tautological beauty.</p>

Sure. But you’re forgetting the formalism of formalism which is the very manner in which the practical existence gets pulled into the formal rules (I think I pointed out that the formal recognition of assumptions as mere assumptions is part of the formalism of formalism and of course the inputs to a model act as assumptive input to the model --- they aren’t justified in anyway other than that they *are* the input --- this would include the inputs of practical experience into the models of our minds --- i.e. practical experience also goes into that building up and falling down of the assumptions of a system based off what I’ve said?).</p>

I.e. its a formalism without formalism: the formalism that protects against this non-answer is the formalism that tautologies are not results, a tautology doesn’t pay the bills. I.e. the very claim that formalism is bad *is* a formalism (i.e. is the start, but not the end, of the formalism of formalism). 

“Desire is in our bodies”

Desire gets projected into our bodies in the form of the symptom, but desire is not *just* in our bodies. But yeah, the truth of the desire is the symptom in our bodies.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> I really don’t see the use in Zizek, or Terry Pinkards criticism of Marx.
Marx’s Poverty of Philosophy pretty much dispatched idealism. Just because some of them are disgruntled about losing doesn’t mean the project of Marxism wasn’t worth the risk, or still is.

I think critiquing Marxism in the abstract is just silly.</p>

The question is whether or not the criticisms are sound and true and all that. If Marx's Poverty of Philosophy overcomes the objections from Zizek and Pinkard tell us how. Judging them as silly and insisting they have been dispatched is to throw truth aside and replace truth with your own will.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Being-for-itself is also “absolute” determination. one definition of absolute is something which depends on nothing else as it’s ground, it’s not dependent on something else for its definition. “Something”is affected and determined by the “other” through its “constitution”. Being-for-self is self sufficient and independently grounded, impervious to change by an other external to it.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@dve.h_37844#0</span> If someone makes the argument that Trotskyists don't understand the whole and then point out what they don't see, makes an argument that Trotskyists don't see something and thereby don't see the whole, countering that they do see the whole without addressing the argument offered to the contrary is, again, merely a willful insistence. 
The truth is something we work out through argumentation and reason and not through insistence.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@douglain#0</span> That doesn’t make *sense* a tool though.
The tool is Marxism, which begins with materialism.
Like when you interviewed Cutrone on philosophy and he said something like “when you show up to the scene of a crime, you first have to determine if a crime has been committed”.
What I don’t want to do is treat materialism as a philosophy. Dialectics, as I understand it, is actually a physical process of nature. We need only look to Engels, or Darwin for proof of this.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@dve.h_37844#0</span> Whether or not you want to treat materialism as a philosophy doesn't determine whether or not materialism is an ontological philosophical position. When you say you don't want to treat it as a philosophy you are saying that you don't want to question your assumptions but accept what amounts to a received opinion as fact. You say, "beyond this point I refuse to think." 
Treating reason as a tool requires that you have put aside trying to discover things and want to work upon a problem in a prescribed way. If I pick up a screwdriver and want to use it as a tool I will have to find screws. But, what if what I'm working on doesn't have screws?</p>

If Engels or Darwin demonstrated that dialectics is a physical process then we should be able to understand their arguments and their arguments should be able to hold up to our scrutiny.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Reading Hegel our task is two fold: First, understand what he said and his arguments. Second, scrutinize what he said and see if we find it convincing. Do Hegel's arguments hold up? What we aren't doing is figuring out what the doxa is, the simple slogan that we can memorize and repeat.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@douglain#0</span> It’s the dictatorship of the proletariat.

I’m happy to discuss Hegel in a more philosophical way, but where Marx is concerned that is hardly the point.
We haven’t seen science disprove what Engels asserted in the Dialectics of Nature. It still holds. So, I’m not sure where to go from here?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@dve.h_37844#0</span> Here's what you do first, stop merely asserting what you think has been established and try, in your own words, to repeat the arguments you learned. How did Engels demonstrate that dialectics are in nature (for instance in a stone) and then tell us how this refutes Hegel's idealism (if you think it does.) 
None of what I've said in this morning has anything to do with Darwin, Marx, Hegel or Engels. What I've been responding to is merely your refusal to engage beyond the level of assertion and insistence.</p>

Fred Hampton wrote about it in terms of Marxism. You have to claim things exist, I exist, I can do things, they seem to affect other things. This isn't a dream or delusion, etc.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> It's a philosophical claim, but seems to be one that carries evidence. And if you discard this claim, action in the world itself becomes a slideshow of meaningless, disconnected, images and perceptions with no relation between them. And there's no motive to do anything, ever, much less anything notable. Aristotle in Nichomachean ethics seems to be arguing with proto-Buddhism when he states that those who don't desire anything, or who champion the death of desires, are removing the motivation to all greatness and all things terrible as well.</p>

I just don’t agree with the assertion from Thomas that Marx didn’t understand Hegel. We all know what Zizek said. I think it’s an absurd thing to say. Why? Well why not grant Marx an in depth understanding of Hegel since he was German and a member of the young Hegelians.
I just don’t care to get into a 30 paragraph dialogue about it. Sorry to disappoint.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> What was the reason Thomas gave for his claim that Marx didn't understand Hegel? 
In general, the rule of thumb should be to read charitably. That is, do not interpret Hegel or Marx as if they are stupid people who say stupid things, but work to see if you can read them so that they are smart and make sense. If, after a charitable reading, you find a mistake then point out the mistake. The question is not whether Marx understood Hegel but rather do we understand Marx's understanding of Hegel. 
The question is not whether Hegel was overturned by Marx, but do we understand Hegel well enough to know what that would mean if true.</p>

Instead take the time to think about it and then, if you feel they have refuted what you've said, try to take that in. If they haven't then offer a counter that takes their coutner claim into account.</p>

I can call you a woke Robin DiAngelo Cultural Marxist because someone credibly claimed that in the past, and some number of people agreed with it. Therefore you've been effectively linked, you can argue based on facts or history, or descriptions of objects in the world, or the past, but I can reply that the object itself has changed and now you are doomed to be renamed at will. So my mistruth has become reality because I can claim the underlying substance of the words themselves have changed.</p>

If the chocolate ration were at some point lower or nothing at all, I could credibly be said to not be lying.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@angelus888#0</span> Let's take an economic example. If the dollar is inflated, it bys three times less than it used to, and I say I made twice as many dollars this year than last then what I'm saying is true. But you'd be right to point out that the dollar is worthe less in purchasing power this year than it was the year before.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I could do a political example too. In 100 BC I could say "I am for the Republic" and mean - the senate, the Popular assembly, elections. And say the same sentence in 10 AD and mean "I am for Augustus," but the meaning of the phrase, "I am for the Republic" can still be logically linked to the former, not the latter, and discarding the latter. But a dialectician, like yourself, would argue that the second, somewhat propagandistic and false, definition, is acutally real now due to changes in the terms of the utterance itself, and now it is impossible to lie. It is impoossible both to be for the republic, and against it, and no amount of pointing to people who meant one thing or another actually matters anymore. No facts matter. Only the meaningless labeling of them.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The meaning of words change over time. It happens. Also, a word will mean one thing in one context and another in another context.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I'll give you an example, 
If you will answer my questions, said Dionysodorus, I will soon extract the same admissions from you, Ctesippus. You say that you have a dog.

Yes, a villain of a one, said Ctesippus.

And he has puppies?

Yes, and they are very like himself.

And the dog is the father of them?

Yes, he said, I certainly saw him and the mother of the puppies come together.

And is he not yours?

To be sure he is.

Then he is a father, and he is yours; ergo, he is your father, and the puppies are your brothers.

Let me ask you one little question more, said Dionysodorus, quickly interposing, in order that Ctesippus might not get in his word: You beat this dog?

Ctesippus said, laughing, Indeed I do; and I only wish that I could beat you instead of him.

Then you beat your father, he said.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Even a word like "blue" I could say to you, and you might imagine light blue,and me, dark blue, it is an apporximation, but both of us are aware of blue. In very ancient times, in both seemingly Ancient Greek and classical Chinese, there was no "blue" there was "qing" (greenish blue, etc) and "wine dark sea" but no true word for blue. Did human brains perceive blue? of course they did, but they did not verbally quantify it.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> One thing then I go back - this process, in history, is often explicit: Herodotus invents words and says so, Aristotle is even more funny about it, he will say "the intermediate term between (two extremes) for which no word exists." I find this so impressive. Pure attempt at material description without even bothering too much about the verbal formula. It's quite a beautiful thing in a way.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> So just the word "GRASS" has no truth value. Nature may be said to natively have: mud, tree, grass, water, sound, wind. But to narrate these into a statement "the wind was blowing in the trees" at least in Aristotle's experience, was a thing only another person could say, in language, gramatically, with some sort of action.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Our disagreement about the use of the word queer isn't about nominalism or anything like that. It's about the reality. I think that when leftists say they're queer they aren't calling themselves a bad name. You think they are. That isn't about the dictionary it's about the attitudes and social reality that actually exists on the left.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@douglain#0</span> We're kinda getting into aristophanes territory. I think this is maybe the bottom line, the truthful description of one thing will only have so many avenues to it's justification in terms of multiple arguments or really, explanations, but in terms of non-facts, untrue arguments, unreal assertions - these are actually infinite.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Yes. That's right. If a guy from Australia says "hey, you cunt" and then explains that he didn't mean it in a sexist way the context of his being Australian might matter.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> It's fun to watch Aristotle try to explain things through money - almost as a fun exercise - I forget exactly where I saw it - whereas it is our DEFAULT mode and we are UTTERLY immured in it. And I mean value maximisation logic based on markets, not socialist ideas, just the general thinking of "be more value generating on weekends, etc" which obviously didn't exist for the Greeks or Romans.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I thought the workshop went well enough and that we are going to get through it to the end with a better understanding. There actually was a lot of agreement. Plus, Thomas nearly convinced me of the many worlds interpretation which means I'll apparently live forever. So, I've got that going for me.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@douglain#0</span> One random note to add that I didn't bring up in our discussion, or perhaps a more parsimonious way of putting my counter-argument: a lot of this boils down an idea that what's true is a bit of a popularity contest, and if enough people endorse an untrue statement it becomes "socially true."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@douglain#0</span> I am truly needing to reflect on the point about solipsism and the need of an other to recognize the existential isolation of our self.
In family therapy theory, the theory of differentiation (by Murray Bowen) says that we only have a sense of Self insofar as we are able to become close to another.
We only realize the particularities of who we are by knowing another person and realizing ourself, how we think and feel, as particular.
But that moment alone only shows us who we are as who we are *not*. In a sense it shows us, if we let it, the contingenctness of who we are; and in that, we can ask ourselves if want to or *ought to* stay this way or not: we can ask *how to be,* or *what to become*; we experience freedom through the self-awareness which came from knowing another as different, and thereby seeing the possibility of difference, where we assumed the necessity of our being.
We experience oneness as external, and faced with multiplicity of Being in possibility, back to indeterminacy. But a relative indeterminacy, a limit.

In being limited, we recognize our commonality. The other person, presumably, also experienced their radical difference in the interaction and was confronted with their contingency, non-universality.
It's the non-universality then, we have in common, and is universal. A negative Universal, we are all not The One.
We join in the Oneness by recognizing our mutual not-One-ness. The impossibility of knowing solipsism except through knowing other persons, which falsifies these hypothesis of solipsism; we experience other persons as simply different.
To question their "reality" as persons implies also a question about our reality: what is it about myself that I am claiming these other persons to not have?
What is it about me that is "Real"??

I think it is precisely the capacity to recognize our relative non-Reality, our finitude, that makes us self-aware, being-for-self, free.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> This is the passage from a section in the book called 'Seperation from the analyst' that I got it from

"I am always a bit puzzled when I hear talk of analysands ending their analysis in a peaceful and friendly manner, and then hear of them befriending their analysts afterward—as if the choice of their former analyst as a friend were an indifferent choice, as if there were not enough other people in the world to befriend. Friendship is not, in and of itself, out of the question, assuming one has surpassed the stage of blaming the Other for one's problems or one's fate.* But it suggests that a certain demand toward the Other—a demand for recognition and approval, in short, for love—may well remain unresolved Peaceful "termination" hardly seems consonant with the reversal of position regarding the onerous renunciation that is required to go beyond castration."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> something that puzzled me was when Hegel says in §195

"Determinateness has not yet severed itself from being."

Why do you think he says that when in the next sentence he says that it will never server itself from being?

If you say has not yet it implies that it will or that it was expected to maybe?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Thinking it over I realize I was unnecessarily rude to you yesterday. I encounter a lot of insistence and assertions online from people both on the left and the right, and in general it bothers me. I feel as though our culture overall operates through insistence, cancellation, power, authority and that reason and discussion and thinking are all way too rare. But, your comments weren't particularly bad examples and I should have, as you said, butted out, rather than reacted to the formal structure of your comments out of context as I did.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The thought of the finitude of things brings this sadness with it because it is qualitative negation pushed to its extreme, and in the singleness of such determination there is no longer left to things an affirmative being distinct from their destiny to perish. Because of this qualitative singleness of the negation, which has gone back to the abstract opposition of nothing and ceasing-to-be as opposed to being, finitude is the most stubborn category of the understanding; negation in general, constitution and limit, reconcile themselves with their other, with determinate being; and even nothing, taken abstractly as such, is given up as an abstraction; but finitude is the negation as fixed in itself, and it therefore stands in abrupt contrast to its affirmative. The finite, it is true, lest itself be brought into flux, it is itself this, to be determined or destined to its end, but only to its end — or rather, it is the refusal to let itself be brought affirmatively to its affirmative, to the infinite, and to let itself be united with it; it is therefore posited as inseparable from its nothing, and is thereby cut off from all reconciliation with its other, the affirmative. The determination or destiny of finite things takes them no further than their end. The understanding persists in this sadness of finitude by making non-being the determination of things and at the same time making it imperishable and absolute. Their transitoriness could only pass away or perish in their other, in the affirmative; their finitude would then be parted from them; but it is their unalterable quality, that is, their quality which does not pass over into its other, that is, into its affirmative; it is thus eternal</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think that this line--The finite...is itself this, to be determined or destined to its end, but only to its end--or rather, it is the refusal to let itself be brought affirmatively to its affirmative, to the infinite, and to let itself be united with it; it is therefore posited and as inseprerable from its nothing--is roughly the same thing as saying that qualitative being is brought to its end.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@douglain#0</span> I think its also saying that if it wanted to the finite could join with its affirmative, the infinite but it stubbornly refuses to so as to maintain itself as what it is rather than just be an amorphous indeteminate thing??</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I remember that when I was struggling with religion in my 20s, trying to figure out if I believed in God, I decided that the problem of death wouldn't really be resolved by what was promised by certain Christian faiths. The promise was that after death I would be reunited with God or the Godhead. What I realized was that my own self would clearly be absorbed and destroyed by such a thing. So death either meant becoming nothing or becoming everything and, from my point of view, there wasn't much of a difference.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> I think the ambiguity is connected to something quite complicated in Doctrine of Essence, where essence is taken to be distinct from being or immediacy; Immediacy becomes appearance, shine, illusory being, I think.
But he also shows it's not really seperable from being, I think.

Thats where it gets complicated; 
Even in something, which Quality is not yet, there is an in-itself which is only implicit, not immediately known.

So that being-in-itself becomes an abstract, mediated by its determinateness, it's not-other. But that's not what it is in-itself. Immediacy and Being become separate.
But the whole development of Something and Other is still based on the ground of the unity of being and nothing, as the whole book is, even Essence, etc..</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@douglain#0</span> Yea; I think Death is about this existence ending, or having an end. That who we are cannot persistent. 
But again it raises the question of the Self: what is it about me that makes me who or what I am?

The more I reflect on this i feel we are lead to a single inevitable conclusion:</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> There does seem something avoiding our real existential isolation and immanent mortality in this mind if ego-death, unity with everything and everyone.
I think that unity has truth equally as our fragile unique individuality born of our freedom.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@douglain#0</span> We are at a point in the dominance-to-collapse curve of postmodernism that we 1) read everything through the lens of postmodernism but 2) postmodernism is already a fatally ill with the pathologies arising from it's own contradictions that will eventually negate it. Example: I recently started reading R.J.B. Bosworth's *Mussolini's Italy: Life Under the Fascist Dictatorship, 1915-1945* (2004? 2007?). In the introduction I was immediately struck by the ideological frame of this huge book being an healthier, more productive, more interesting, and more vibrant school of postmodernism that we have discarded. Here's a quote, from literally the start of the preface: “The recovery of the voices lost within the totalizing narratives of modernization and nationalization is one of the most challenging tasks facing historians today, but before we can even begin to identify and listen to these voices, we must first understand the mechanisms by which they have been (and continue to be) silenced.” So this is healthier postmodernism - examining the information lost through empashsis on grand narrative structures like Italian Fasicsm, that could end up blotting out the granularity of the thing in real life. This is not the postmodernism of today which essentially has settled for equating all utterances as equal from an evidentiary perspective, where claims can't really even be made about things, where nothing can be said to be better or worse than anything else, where nothing causes anything, etc., history is reduced to a child's mobile of entertaining textures, sights, sounds, and tinklings. My fear is that this perspective has essentially penetrated all dominions of human knowledge and practice, from philosophy to history to business to Human Resources planning to, of course, politics.   EDIT: So that's why I don't think either of us WANT to be postmodern sophists, per se, but we are trapped in the gravity of this thing that is quite omnipresent.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I was just targeting he and our discussion very narrowly. It has crossed my mind that everyone is reading Hegel as a postmodernist though, yes, though we're doing this at a near-unconsious level since it's literally the water we're swimming in. I know I was reading Aristotle that way, Plato that way, but I have to work hard to throw away that frame and say Plato **IS** making a claim or Cicero **IS** attempting to assert something here. Not allow the inner Lyotard in my brain to win. EDIT: I can't determine to what extent it's postmodern Hegel here as I'm not versed enough to say.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Can you say more about how we are reading Hegel as a postmodernist?
Or what that means in general?
As though these authors are not making claims?

What are *you claiming* exactly?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> But I guess the thing also to note is that postmodernism was useful at some point, as that quote shows. But it experienced decay, now it's just sophistry, equating nothings, etc.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I'm more exploring a position that us as readers at this time are investing an entire assumed postmodern outlook on these texts that do not exist within them. They are seeing their claims-making in a way that is nearly alien to us, and we must be able to sieze our framework, shatter it, and try to figure out what they are saying on their own terms.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I'm not sure I have defined this observation and watched the move in time of that postmodernist window well enough - which is explicit in the historical text I just mentioned - to be able to formulate a hypothesis on approaching this issue.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I listened to a panel w Spivak from the 80s and she was basically saying that same thing: not letting grand narratives exclude marginal truths or whatever.
I just don't understand why not do that dialectically to fold it into the "grand narrative"?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> If I were to make a (somewhat parodic, and morbid) Postmodernist claim it would be something like: "Actually reading postmodernism into Hegel is good because it's more appopsite to our times and there is no truth contained within any text, it is always a linguistic performance that can be re-interpreted at any time, with all interpretations being equally valid."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Right. I think that's the claim in question: is there truth within the text?
What does truth mean in this sense? 
Thankfully, that's what Hegels book is about and he develops all his terms immanently, so it's well suited to reading on its own terms</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think there are a range of interpretations that come close to whatever is in the original of a non-random text, which are intended. Since a person speaking, at any point, must have some idea in their head as to what they are speaking about. That said, misreadings can also be very valuable and interesting, and provide room for creativity where a set of known elements is broken, and new elements are invented or related.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> But from a didactic perspective yes, you'd want an accurate view, but what I am saying is this is challeneged by some very deep preconcepts in the reader. It's like trying to read classical lit without Christianity leering at you, it's very hard, and even harder to reconstruct the pagan audience of these things in your brain, which was the major audience.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The only difference between Being and Existence is the latter is in unity with Nothing, right?
Idk why the online one doesn't use the term existent that much. Seems v helpful</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> that seems right to me.

The online one is the Miller one which is much earlier and considered the definitive one. The Cambridge ones more recent.

I think Houlgate prefers the Miller one in general and prefers the translation "determinate Being". Its partly to do with Existence implying Dasein being an actual object at this point, which some do believe but he doesnt, i tend to agree with him. I do think Dasein is kind of the foundation for existense tho. Existence in general as apposed to something that exists.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Ive google translated it as this
existence emerges from becoming. Dasein is the simple oneness of being and not. For the sake of this simplicity it has the form of something immediate.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> If the form of something is its shape and determinateness determines what shape a thing takes in contrast to something else, wouldnt it make sense that form meant determinateness?
like a thing looses its form when it looses its determinateness. It is no longer itself but just the eggman or the walrus.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Im thinking maybe form could be related to somethings limit. As the thing itself and its limit aren't seperate, this would coincide with the idea that content isnt differenciated from form.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> 'in the form of being' would mean its defined as being or takes shape as a being as apposed to a nonbeing. Although the german seems to say that its "in the form of something immediate" but then only being is immediate perhaps. nothing is mediation.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Determinate Being is the sublated unity of Pure being and nothing; Is-ness and not -ness.
Quality is this determinate-ness; it's not yet 'a being' but it is, it exists, only immediate;

I think of it like; a baby coming out of empty undifferentiated mind, would notice a thing first by noticing the quality of the thing.
If they first saw a red ball, they'd see redness and ballness before they saw it as a ball.
It's immediate in that sense, of not even yet a thing but the aspects which would make a thing a thing</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> In the line I quoted I think Hegel clearly thinks that form means determinateness.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> ah or did you agree with me but I didnt understand you? I was gonna say Quality, limit, determinateness etc. could all be form, form takes many forms (haha)</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Re Form: 
I think it's like shape except for the spacial aspect of shape.
It's also often thought in contrast to content. Form, in that, is akin to appearance (content akin to essence).

Like Quality as such is a form, but particular qualities have content; but like, red ball is more a ball than it is red; it's a ball in a red *form*.

But also, concepts are 'forms' in a way; the ancient Greek word for form is 'Eidos', and 'idea' was the feminine form of the word.
Ironically it also means essence.
Platonic Forms are essences of ideas that are the most real, to him.
Aristotle juxtaposed form with matter, in saying everything is a mixture of both. For example, body and soul, or brain and mind, are supposed to be examples. A knife is made of metal, but what make it a knife is having a blade and handle, the form the metal is shaped into; not just the shape, but also the implicit purpose of cutting, etc.
Here they're very contentful. The form is the interesting part. 
Hegel seems to be distinguishing form and ideality; ideality seems to be closer to Plato's and Aristotle's ideas of form. Hence, form and content almost reverses form and matter in which is interesting.

For example a "something" is more a form without content. It's just like the idea of something. Is the idea of a something a something? 

The rational kernal of formalism, imo. Is that we cannot think without forms; Heidegger tries to do so, I'm still trying to to sort through it.
Poetry does it. But poetry is the opposite of rigour; it's trying to do something entirely different. Poets are trying to say more than they intend.

Philosophy needs forms of thought which are clear, so that we know exactly what we are saying.
Hegel's emphasis on immanent development is precisely this; that if a terms is brought from outside, it becomes one-sided, and smuggles in assumptions unexamined; but his critique of understanding, to me, is also a critique of over reliance on forms which I have been calling formalism.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I did look up the German and Hegel uses the specific word, even with a capital F.
He definitely means it there in some philosophically significant way which we may not have access to.
But that's why I tried to give my philosophical understanding of it.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Thanks for the background on the term. I would say it isn’t spatial temporal at this point but I think it will be later on right?
I think he also talked a bit in the intro/prefaces about the unity of form and content in the same way he might talk about the unity of subject and object, about the unity of opposites. I was wondering if we might have an example of that here in form of limit which can’t be thought of apart from what it’s limiting.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> I'm sad chat has died down. Was I too argumentative or is the Being-for-itself chapter too Idealist?

A friend mentioned to me the introduction to Philosophy of Right is about self-determination, freedom. So I stared checking it out to see if it's connected.
He says animals are not free because they cannot "place before it's mind what it desires"

So freedom requires this reflection of desire. It's the ability of thought to negate the desire. He then goes into Negative Freedom as one-sided, using the familiar example of "Hindus" in meditation. He again calls this "pure intuition", "abstraction from all definite character". Sounds a lot like Being.
<@805731746384445460> but he adds that "this indefiniteness [Being?] is itself only a negation."</p>

I havent been reading too much Hegel unfortunately.
I did the day of and after the last time. And want to this week. But I need larger chunks of time to sink into it than other things I read.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Something I was struggling with a bit was negation of negation, I need to go to bed right now but Ill try and formulate something to say about it tomorrow. I know that something is supposed to be the first real negation of negation and that it involves self mediation. I think its at work in this process of simultaneously being other than itself through change but also retaining its identity with itself which is the quality of being-in-itself.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> "he rational kernal of formalism, imo. Is that we cannot think without forms; Heidegger tries to do so, I'm still trying to to sort through it.
Poetry does it. But poetry is the opposite of rigour; it's trying to do something entirely different. Poets are trying to say more than they intend."

Where do you get that idea from? I'd say it is precisely what distinguishes poetry from prose that it treats form as a structural factor, not just an ornamental one.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Its not too argumentative in the sense that we didn't need to argue, but arguing takes something out of me and I have a 9 to 5 these days. I'm not certain about this line on being being only a negation (i.e. I'm not certain if this sentence is a bridging sentence or a defining sentence, one that bridges being into something like its being for other, or if he's saying 'well being is really nothing' here: either way I still think that what gives being this feeling of emptiness is the way that it is associated with pure identity and formality and that what is negative within it is 'truth' --- i.e. it is 'true' but only tautologically true). My way of resolving all this is simply to notice that 'not' can produce truth because it can 'not' itself ('not not') while with being if you want to get back to 'not' you have to play tricks (specifically, you have to get someone to buy that the thing which everything has in common is nothing, which a metaphysical idealist is unlikely to just buy: once again, to me this is why Hegel spends so much time talking about being in the first chapter's remarks and justifying his starting there: because its not the appropriate place to start really and I think it is this 'starting' which is the problem for Hegel's idealism, he starts with tautology and then has to kind of bootstrap himself out of it).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> The other thing is that on fomalism vs informalism: I think that my problem is that when people say that something is 'just a formalism' they think what is being demanded is 'informalism' as something before form. Whereas what I'm demanding is dialectics which is after form in the sense that its the infinite of form (form turned back into and against itself, or form taken as the one becoming the many). 

I also have this other strange thought when considering Hegel: in Engels (and maybe Marx) the difference between materialism and idealism is often given as being on of practicality vs. theory and how theory has to flow from practice... but it seems that Hegel doesn't exactly disagree with this in the following sense: he starts with the most practical categories to hand (not the most 'correct' I think, but the most practical) --- what is and what isn't --- and then develops off into the more theoretical realms (his theory follows his more basic practice). So I don't think this base and superstructure argument is actually the real disagreement between Marx-Engels and Hegel (or that its the *real* division between idealism and materialism). 

I know that <@476561351167311872> was talking about how there is some kind of universality in being non-universal. I would relate this to the division between the masculine (there is a universal, but there is an exception) and the feminine (there is no universal, no exceptions) in Lacan. Both are contradictions but they are subtly different ways of handling the contradiction (masculine is a contradiction because it claims a universal but then wishes to except it, feminine is a contradiction because the fact that there is no exception to the statement that there is no universal means the statment that there is no universal is itself a universal).</p>

Most of its spent procrastinating to be honest but you need that time as well. Its all about "TIMEENERGY" as David McKerracher puts it and I have that in spades if not much else. Its kind of ideal for me.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> Oh i see what you are saying. that's very interesting. That poetry takes form seriously and unites it with the content.
I meant, not so much the poetic form, but the use of imagery in poetry. So like, epic poems, which use iambic pentameter obviously take form seriously. But most contemporary poetry does not use a standard form, but plays with it, and stretches it, in that sense uses it in artistic unity of the whole. 
but the artistic whole, is for poetry, rather outside the forms; its not the literal meaning, the structure, the rhymes. 
To me, poetry is the epitome of non-literalism (in words). A lot of modern poetry is conveying imagery, and only in the image, with the tone and feel of the language, does the real content of the poem come through. 
That's what I mean by poetry going beyond form. It's not just prose written with an intentional structure asform; that form is also only gesturing beyond itself</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> I still struggle with the idea that Being exists in itself apart from something that that being applies to. (technically it doesnt exist actually anyway because existence is determianate Being??) I instinctually feel like how Kant said that *something* is the most abstract thing you can think of and Being can't be thought apart from something that is.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I'm not saying its not true. I'd just like to hear a good argument that there is pure Being at all. Afterall this is kind of the principle of Hegels whole philosophy.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> maybe pure Being is only implicit in our thinking and is nothing more than that. I guess Kant is saying not that something is the most abstract thing that *exists* rather that its just the most abstract concept for him (do abstractions exist?).

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> although for Hegel something is determined internally in-itself I believe. Maybe its more accurate to say Determinate Being or Quality is initially everything.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I found the last remark from Infinity to be very helpful in understanding Ideality which is essential to Being-for-itself.
Ideality has felt like a key concept in understanding the conceptual turns of the whole chapter.
He defines Being-for-itself as sublating otherness; he gives the example of consciousness because we can represent external objects, or even the idea of an external world, in our mind. So such the ideation is a way we sublate our other in ourselves.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> I think you're right being-in-itself is how something exists in isolation, as opposed to existing in relation to an other (being-for-other) but everything has to be determined negatively, how do you think something can be determined when it is on its own? It is determined by the negation in itself, so I think I'm right that something is determined internally. It is also the negation of negation: In Quality you have Reality which is then negated and something is the negation of that negation, whereby being is reaffirmed again.
I'm still trying to work out what the significance of Negation of Negation is though, not something I grasp totally.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> My understanding is that it begins with two determinations, being-in-itself which is only implicit, and being-for-other.
The logical development shows that the determination of for-other is immanent to the idea of something.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> So have you been reading chapter 3 at all?
I will say, sometimes moving on, you see how the concepts are used, and it helps when you go back.
I find an approach of progress by waves, pushing forwards, then receding back and then pushing forward to be what's working best for me.
Also keeps its more interesting</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> The significance of negation of negation is two fold --- one the thing double negated isn't the original thing (this is the old cliche of dialectics that most sects will teach if they concern themselves with this question at all) second that a thing negates *itself* so we're back to negation of negation, quality of quality, something of something, etc. --- i.e. you have apply the concept to itself to finally see how it breaks out of itself.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> (and really they are all negative above 'nothing' but tbh I think nothing is the base of this whole structure and sublation --- negation of negation --- is the 2-level analytic move par excellence of the dialectical process that hegel is describing).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> I’m referring to something, the original negation of negation, being that it literally negates the concept of negation which previously negated reality.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I’m trying to figure out at the moment if negativity(neg of neg) is the same as “change” which is the endless othering of the other that happens in something and other. I thought they were before because their structure seems so similar to me but I’m not sure now.
There’s at least 3 things going on in something. 1. Change and 2. negativity which both determine how something has selfhood in isolation and 3. simple negation against the other which lead to its being limited. I assumed the first 2 were totally related but now I’m not sure.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Just read mctaggarts commentary on being-for-self, all three pages of it! 😄 he basically goes through each saying this is invalid, this is unnecessary, this next part is irrelevant etc etc 😄</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> To sum it up: being-for-self is being but now determined completely internally, it’s determining limit is within itself now so it’s self sufficient, requires nothing apart from itself for its definition. being-for-self is “one” it is for-one since it is not for-other (other relatedness which has been sublated). One implies many of the same, the one and many repulse and attract each other like particles in physics so that they are “equipoised” and one doesn’t get entangled with the other or reconstitute the other in any way, thus we arrive at a multiplicity of self-contained alike things and this is quantity.</p>

Would you be available next weekend and we could just go over the first chapter starting with being through to becoming and deteriminate being?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Well, I actually have been keeping up with the reading, but I haven't been memorizing and sometimes I read a section and don't fully grasp it. For instance, today, I had trouble with the section on repulsion and even the section before that about the many and the one.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think if I did my own logic of science it would start: 'Nothing --- total lack of self identity --- contradiction. Thus the answer to any question about it must be 'No.' While easy inmmediate contradictions pose themselves, such as the question "is the nothing that to which every question concerning it must be 'No'?", these questions are no problem for the nothing from its own perspective as, being a contradiction, it easily grounds any such further contradiction. 

However, while the nothing itself easily presents us with contradiction,  there is something beyond the nothing implicit in its concept. 

'No,' a necessary consequence of nothing is not burdened with the same necessity to respond 'no' to every question concerning its nature. This mere falsity --- less than nothing --- allows for alternative responses: in fact any possible response. To the question "Is 'no' a word?", the answer may be yes while to the question "is no true for all questions concerning our existing concepts" the answer may still be  'no.' Thus we have introduced the further concept of tautology: the answers to all questions concerning 'no' are 'yes or no'.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> This tautology,  however, is being itself which assigns a truth to every existing object: that is, both to 'no' a falsity which is less than nothing, and to 'yes or no' i.e. tautology. 

This generates 'yes' alone and it is here that we might fail by simply falling back into tautology or alternatively 'no': noticing that yes applied to any previous concept simply returns that concept: oscillating in its answers depending upon its other. When we say 'yes, the answer is no' we mean that the answer is no whereas when we say 'yes the answer is yes' we mean it remains yes.  In this way 'yes' or 'truth' acts as a becoming... except: when we apply this yes-identity as an affirmation of contradiction-nothing something interesting happens.  Rather than returning back to us the contradiction which always returns 'no' to every question we instead get back a contradiction which always returns 'yes'. This is opposed also to tautology, which always returns yes by way of a pivot: tautology follows the formula 'yes, it either is or isn't' -- 'however this new contradiction responds merely 'yes' or to make it clearer 'yes, it both is and is not.' It is this *positive* contradiction which is named by hegel 'determinate being.' The being in which each positive determination or concept must be equally burdened by distinction from another which it is *not*. In this way the ground is laid anew for a reconsideration of four (but really five) logical concepts.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Otherwise, there isn't really a justification for the move from becoming to determinate being: at least not in the text --- if I remember correctly hegel just asserts it as a new jumping off point and while I observed that there does seem to be a distinction between the two (outer contradiction in becoming --- the yes needs the preexisting no to oscillate between itself and not itself, inner contradiction in determinate being) --- but the need for this move is not obvious in that section I think and I was doing a lot of lifting to draw out this distinction for <@589918821729566721>  (who seemed to notice the distinction but didn't know what it was exactly).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> But it does play nicely into a new thought I've had about cynicism: which is in the mode of truth as pure truth (becoming, the 'yes'). That the reason cynicism follows the formula 'i know very well but I know' is that its acting as if the nuerotic obsessive rule (I must know, yes or no) continues to operate as a protection against falsehood even as it takes steps that go against the obsessive tautology: specifically because cynicism affirms everything in its truth, it risks also affirming a negative contradiction in its truth and thus generating a positive contradiction.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> So while the obsessive maintains a separation of concerns between true and false (is rejecting contradiction) through their constant updating of action according to knowledge (new knowledge causes them to radically adjust behavior to maintain the distinction between yes or no so that the tautology always remains true) the cynic behaves *as if* their new knowledge will lead to this outcome *automatically* even though it doesn't. Thus 'they know very well but they know' --- they know what they're doing is perverse but because they know they think that things should automatically change to protect them *because* that's what happens in the case of the (tautological) nuerotic obsessive. But they forget, or rather merely perversely 'know' that this happened for the obsessive because the obsessive is moving specifically to constantly maintain the tautological stance even while the cynic is merely oscillating between positive and negative haphazardly without being careful to *not* oscillate into a contradiction: something an obsessive is horrified by. 

Thank God (nothing) there is a position beyond cynicism and nuerotic obsession.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@douglain#0</span> This conversation between you and I, whether the chocolate ration is increasing or decreasing in 1984, whether you can get away with redefining all homosexuality as "queer" then making us a minority in our own movement to spicy hets, and then as a result if I can then also redefine you as a "woke cultural DEI marxist" and do the exact same operation to you, has been incredibly, incredibly intellectually fruitful to me. I've had multiple inspirations from it. I think in short it shows the trouble that dialecticians have with the truth, the tendency to invert truth and lie, and to slide into situations where professions, people, things - end up doing the opposite of what their (Platonic) form would suggest they do. We get doctors who kill, as in Nazi germany, firemen who set fires - as in Ray Bradbury's *Fahrenheit 451*, agricultural scientists who create starvation (Trofim Lysenko), and now "LGB"TQ+ orgs who are more aggressively chemically and surgically converting LGB youngsters than any Christian group has, ever. I also seeming now see arguments for the vitiation // elimination of both "informed consent" and "do no harm" in medicine. Medicine against medicine, in the name of (Hegelian concepts of? ethics?), perhaps.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I'd also say it caused me to think about "truth" from a dialectical perspective and that was a whole other inspiration it gave me. If we think about Chocolate as points on a graph (0 grams - or unknown), then 100 grams, then 75 grams, then 40 grams - we can determine 75 was decreased to 40. The statement "The chocolate ration was decreased" is true materially, and also not deceptive, and also temporally most relevant - which may be why it is not deceptive. Changing the frame, we can say 0 was INCREASED to 40 - but this is deception. There is an extra element here - telling something that may be factually true, but which is deceptive (maybe because it's untrue IN TIME) and omits or deletes data that shows its deception - mainly that there was an even higher point (100g) that we are failing to mention.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> This second point regarding a dialectical approach to "truthful" but perhaps better put low-quality truthful statements or truthful-but-deceptive statements, or manipulative statements, I've only started to explore, but it is fascinating.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think Materialism provides a torch for illiminating these deceptions, attaching specific utterances to specific meanings, and exiting the hall of mirrors that one can otherwise get trapped in with regards to flexible and deceptive definitions.</p>

I think the main meeting in 2 weeks would be carrying on from where we got to. I need to do more work on the Being-for-Self chapter for sure but lets see what <@386755556817240065> says.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> thought this was dang interesting, ive seen this guy on Theory Underground before. I was thinking about absolute or pure knowing because it is explicitly stated as the presupposition of the Science of Logic by Hegel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvyHH17E6ng</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> It seems that Absolute knowing (the end point of both the Phenomenology and SoL I believe, even tho they might be named slightly differently) is indeterminate which is very interesting. It makes me think obviously of pure indeterminate Being but also of Being-for-Self I think because Being-for-Self has a certain lack of Determinacy from the fact that it isn't determined by external negation against an other.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think its very important if we are going to go back and read 'with what the science must begin' that we have some handle on what Absolute knowing is about becasue he references it there as the beggining point of the Logic (while also claiming it is a beggining from the most abstract thing which is interesting)</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> I guess Doug said he wasn't going to share the recording, so idk how y'all left off.

When I left, <@805731746384445460> 's objection to the lack of "method" brings up the important questions I think.

In the Preliminary Notion of Encyclopedia Logic, Hegel has some interesting quotes:
"The necessity of understanding Logic in a deeper sense than as the science of the mere form of thought is enforced by the interests of religion and politics, of law and morality.
......
The Greek philosophers, for example, became antagonists of the old religion, and destroyed its beliefs. Philosophers were accordingly banished or put to death, as revolutionists who had subverted religion and the state, two things which were inseparable. Thought, in short, made itself a power in the real world, and exercised enormous influence. The matter ended by drawing attention to the influence of thought, and its claims were submitted to a more rigorous scrutiny, by which the world professed to find that thought arrogated too much and was unable to perform what it had undertaken It had not — people said — learned the real being of God, of Nature and Mind. It had not learned what the truth was. What it had done was to overthrow religion and the state It became urgent therefore to justify thought, with reference to the results it had produced: and it is this examination into the nature of thought and this justification which in recent times has constituted one of the main problems of philosophy."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Also this passage on his relationship to ancient religion:
"It may be well at the commencement of logic to examine the story which treats of the origin and the bearings of the very knowledge which logic has to discuss. For, though philosophy must not allow herself to be overawed by religion, or accept the position of existence on sufferance, she cannot afford to neglect these popular conceptions. The tales and allegories of religion, which have enjoyed for thousands of years the veneration of nations, are not to be set aside as antiquated even now."

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> When Svetaketu was twelve years
old he was sent to a teacher,
with whom he studied until he was twenty-four. After learning
all the Vedas, he returned home full of conceit in the belief that
he was consummately well educated, and very
censorious.
His father said to him,
'Svetaketu, my child, you who are so
full of your learning and so censorious, have you asked for that
knowledge by which we hear the unbearable, by
which we perceive what cannot be perceived and know what cannot be known?'
'What is that knowledge, sir?' asked Svetaketu.
His father replied, 'As by knowing one lump of clay
all that
is made of clay is known, the difference being only
in name, but
the truth being that all is clay so, my child,
is that knowledge,
knowing which we know all.'
'But surely these venerable teachers of mine are ignorant of
this knowledge; for if they possessed
it they would have imparted it to me. Do you, sir, therefore give me that knowledge.'
'So be it,' said the father. . . . And he said,
'Bring me a fruit of
the nyagrodha tree.'
'Here is one, sir.'
'Break it.'
'It is broken, sir.'
'What do you see there?'
'Some seeds, sir, exceedingly
small.'
'Break one of these.'
'It is broken, sir.'
'What do you see there?'
'Nothing at all.'
The father said, 'My son, that subtle essence which you do not
perceive there in that very essence stands the being of the huge
nyagrodha tree. In that which is the subtle essence all that exists
has its self. That is the True, that is the Self, and thou, Svetaketu,
art That.'
'Pray, sir' said the son, 'tell me more'
'Be it so, my child,' the father replied; and he said, 'Place
this salt in water, and come to me tomorrow morning.'
The son did as he was told.
Next morning the father said,
'Bring me the salt which you put
in the water.'</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The son looked for it, but could not find it; for the salt, of
course, had dissolved.
The father said,
'Taste some of the water from the surface of
the vessel. How is it?'
'Salty.'
'Taste some from the middle. How is it?'
'Salty.'
'Taste some from the bottom. How is it?'
'Salty.'
The father said, 'Throw the water away and then come back
to me again'.
The son did so ; but the salt was not lost, for salt exists for
ever.
Then the father said, 'Here likewise in this body of yours,
my son, you do not perceive
the True; but there in fact it is.
In that which is the subtle essence,
all that exists has its self. That
is the True, that is the Self, and thou, Svetaketu, art That"

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I agree that probably that is very important for understanding Hegel's idealism ^ (the one is), my only difficulty is that I'm not an idealist but rather a dialectical materialist (there is no one).

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think there is no one that is neither immediate nor mediated (or to put it another way, I think there is nothing which is neither immediate nor mediated) --- and I don't think this nothing is completely equivalent to Hegel's being, in so much as Hegel's being is this immediate emptiness which unites all reality under a single banner: there are still positive responses possible for this being (we can say its self-identical for example). I think that there is no such thing that unites everything, there is nothing that provides this unity(in both a common sensical way of using the word 'nothing' *and* in the 'that to which all answers are no' way of using the word 'nothing' --- i.e. negative contradiction, 'for all x, not x'). This is important because I want nullity to both impact reality (i.e. I want its consequences to *not* be stripped out as a nothing, all these contradictory movements which we clearly observe) but *I* also don't want people to treat contradiction as if it doesn't have any importance at all as an impossibility (i.e. I want it to actually be nothing). *And* I also don't want people to say that things which actually are possible are impossible. *And* I want a single starting point, and Hegel's being... it isn't really a single starting point: yes he says that the being is nothing (and I agree, but only because I think everything is a sublation of this nothing, starting with the first object to 'be', the less than nothing 'no' --- so because being is a sublation of nothing it is *also* nothing) but while it is *a* nothing I don't think its the nothing which is actually forced to generate something: rather I think that this comes about because Hegel smuggles nothing into it. I also *bring* nothing into it, but the nothing I bring in is not smuggled in would be my difference.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think a good attack against my position would be the assertation that my nothing exists in-itself, or as-such: not the 'no' which does exist, but rather 'that which all questions about it are answered no'.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> If I understand you correctly, you're rejecting Hegel's doctrine of 'The One's? And the idea that there "such a thing that unites everything", ie Being (which is of course, not a thing, but I get you)?

What I am understanding is that you are rejecting the *unity* of everything. Is that right?

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> For all x, x exists (x is consistent), x is not a universal --- i.e. "there is no" (trigger phrase for inconsistency) universal. The argument is that it's the only position from which nothing is assumed (both in a negative --- I'm not assuming anything --- and in the positive sense: the no-thing is assumed) its this unity of opposites at the level of occams razor is the point of it.</p>

At least that's (one of) my understandings of drive.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Here is a section from the book "A Commentary To Hegels Science Of Logic" by David Gray Carlson which explains where Hegel derives the Begining of the Logic from and why it is immediacy and Being.

"""With What Must Science Begin?

Here is a good place to regress and discuss the essay that precedes Pure Being. Hegel's goal is to develop a presupposition-free philosophy that provides its own foundations. Starting with an unproved "given" is precisely a surrender to superstition. Ever the enemy of philosophy, stipulation is "stupid." Every other science distinguishes its subject matter and scientific method. The subordinate sciences are permitted premises that are taken for granted. But Logic may not presuppose any forms, "for these constitute part of its own content and have first to be established within the science." (43) Yet Hegel begins - with Pure Being. Isn't choosing to begin a contingency and a presupposition? Hegel admits this. "All that is present is simply the resolve, which can be regarded as arbitrary, to consider thought as such." (70) Hegel remarks: "What philosophy begins with must be either mediated or immediate." (67) But which beginning shall we stipulate? He chooses immediacy, but on what basis? Hegel justifies the choice because what is here presupposed is (much later) proven. By "proven" he means that the very last step of the Logic (Absolute Idea, which is the same as Absolute Knowledge)** mediates the first step. His philosophy will take us in a circle. If the beginning is also the end, then the beginning is justified. At this point, the end and the beginning will be a "mediated cognition," which is what Hegel...</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> ...says proof is, (481) Absolute Knowing (or Method) is the unity of mediation - all the mediations there are - and pure immediacy. It is the final step in the Logic. At that point, the absolutely immediate is also the absolutely mediated. The ultimate step, Hegel says, "is the immediate, but the immediate resulting from sublation of mediation . . . This result is therefore the truth. It is equally immediacy and mediation." (837) Pure Being, then, is merely a one-sided view of Absolute Knowing - the side of immediacy. In order to begin, Absolute Knowing breaks itself apart in a gesture of abstraction (since Pure Being will not suffer being merely a "part" in a greater whole). Absolute Knowing, "in  its absolute self-assurance and inner poise," (843) stands back from its content, "allowing it to have free play." (73) The first move belongs to the Understanding. Hegel warns that it is essential to start in this one-sided way. Any other start provides a result, not a beginning. (72) "[T]he immediate of the beginning must be in its own self deficient and endowed with the urge to carry itself further." (829) Hegel's "famous and irritating beginning" is therefore a failure - an attempt to conceive of an unmediated self-identity. Immediacy and mediation are "unseparated and inseparable and the...</p>

(68) And because the beginning is a failure, "advance is not a kind of superfluity; this it would be if that which the beginning is made were in truth already the absolute." (829) As Hegel emphasizes throughout the SL, the fate of a self-identical (or "diverse") entity is to disappear and render itself into nothing. This The Beginning is already foretold in Figure 1(b). Pure Being is the first diversity to show its own nothingness. It is often said that Hegel intends the last step of the Logic to be the first. This needs refinement. The first step comprehends immediacy as such - Pure Being. It may be said that Pure Being is the antepenultimate step - the third from last. In effect, the Understanding falls back two steps and produces an abstraction. From this retrogressive move, progress is necessitated."""</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> As Hegel puts it "This pure Being is the unity into which pure knowing withdraws" §107

So the way I see it Thomas debating whether Being or Nothing is the most fundamental element is missing the point of why Hegel is starting from Being. He's starting with Being because thats what pure Knowing withdraws into at the end of the development.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Also Hegel says that positive and negative are more developed determinations of Being and Nothing so when you liken Being to 'yes' and Nothing to 'no' which you do in your argument you're not refering to the pure Being and Nothing that Hegel is, youre using them in their more developed forms of yes and no that only appear later.

"Of course, since we are speaking here of a particular actual something, those determinations are no longer present in it in the complete untruth in which they are as being and nothing; they are in a more developed determination, and are grasped, for example, as positive and negative, the former being posited, reflected being, the latter posited, reflected nothing; the positive contains as its abstract basis being, and the negative, nothing." §138

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Im just going to repost here what I posted on the Sublation website group incase people didnt see it there.

I’ve got a couple of suggestions I think would to help the meetings be more focused.

I would like to suggest that every session we focus on a smaller particular selection of the text like 20-25 (or however many) paragraphs so that the group is more focused. For me particularly the smaller the better but I know that might not be popular with everyone who might want to go faster but what are peoples thoughts on that? That workload would be much more manageable for me than half a chapter at a time or whatever.

Also Doug if you are going to bring up particular sections in the group I would find it helpful if you could make it known which paragraphs they will be, if not a day before then at least a few hours before the meeting, so we could make sure we’ve read them.

Whatever we decide I would find it helpful to have a more clear view of what exactly we will read and talk about rather than flicking from one thing to the other all the time and never zooming in on specifics. Not to say there isnt a place for that kind of wide scope of course but I did find it interesting when whe focused on that one paragraph last session even though the atmosphere was pretty tense after me throwing a tantrum.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> No I'm not missing the point, I'm disagreeing with it --- because part of my claim is that pure knowing is not primarily being, but rather primarily nothing: the pure knowing will consist primarily in the knowledge of the tenuousness of knowledge itself: maybe not for Hegel, Hegel may think that pure knowing *is* more than I do (i.e. he's stepping through everything as if its being, whereas I would take all his steps and point out that they are various nothings), but I'm saying that the materialist position lies in the failure of pure knowing, and so I'm ending at nothing as well... so I don't misunderstand Hegel. I disagree with Hegel. 

So, I take that 'no' is more developed than 'nothing-contradiction' --- that's always a part of my argument (and also that 'yes' is more developed than being-tautology). But I *disagree* with Hegel that being is prior to 'no': I think first there is nothing and then 'no' develops out of this nothing (i.e. no is more developed than nothing) before being in its purity can appear, and the being is extracted from this 'no' (because I think that being simply isn't immediate for materialism. I agree that Hegel thinks it is, but for materialism what is immediate is nothing). This being *for me* is tautology from which we can then extract 'yes' (so it goes general object (nothing-contradiction) -> particular (no) -> general object (being-tautology) -> particular (yes)). In this precise sense, that I hold no and yes as being more developed versions of nothing and being: I keep with Hegel.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> That reminds me, you mentioned last time that your argument was Occam's Razor, "the simplest possible explanation is usually correct". But applying OR in a metaphysical context is tricky to say the least because very complex statements can be the simplest possible. The natural numbers are the simplest they could possibly be, which means they are very, very complex. This ties into my general point that, if you're assuming everything possible comes out of contradiction, then you have some rule determining what is possible, and that is a thing.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> Well, yes, the 'no' that is simultaneously distinct from and the same as nothing-contradiction is this rule (or rather its beginning). The 'no' which is a response to every question concerning nothing-contradiction, is the beginning of 'possibility'. However, this no is *also* a requirement of the nothing, its total aspect and response, and so its simultaneously nothing (the heart of what assuming nothing is) and less than nothing (because actual nothing returns this no matter what, but what is returned, the 'no', sometimes returns something other than no which we only find out, after the tautological step, is 'yes'), it bridges the gap between nothing and being. 

The fact that this 'no' is also another nothing (a less than nothing) is what makes the nothing-contradiction into the simplest possible explanation. I agree that it blows up eventually (even into something as complicated as the ideological horizon of being), but as an internal consequence of its own logic moving through various oughts... in the same way that the natural numbers are a consequence of '0' moving through various oughts (if I have zero, then I have 1 because I have 1 object: i.e. zero. But if I have one and zero then I have '+1' because 1 is '+1' from zero, but if I have '+1' then I have all the natural numbers through repetitive applications of '+1', etc.)</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> So when it comes to 'possibility' there's something important that I might not have fully grasped when I first mentioned it. It seems you might want to limit what is possible to specific definitions, like saying 'possibility is a sentence in this language,' 'a category,' or 'a theory and a model.' However, I'm emphasizing, particularly through my use of the word 'no,' (which can also be interpreted as 'not') a critique against confining 'possibility' within such a tautological boundary. This critique is aimed at the notion that 'what is possible' encompasses everything that is 'not impossible' and what is more, that everything possible is first impossible/contradiction --- it then moves out of that through this fleck of non-contradiction in its own kind of 'no' or 'negation' (which will have more and more advanced interpretations as the possible develops) but precisely because it has such a no or negation it must, necessarily end up back in a contradiction out of which a new kind of 'no' develops as a kind of piece of dangling being that is less than nothing left over as everything negates everything else down to nothing-contradiction. 

So that's what I mean by 'no' setting up what is possible: its precisely that each contradiction has a proceeding realm of possibility which establishes the contradiction, but the contradiction, being 'for all x, x' also can be interpreted as 'for all x, not x' and this new 'not x' in the context of the new contradiction creates a new 'not' that can then act to establish a new realm of the possible (but doesn't necessarily do so, it has to somehow lock against itself to really build up a new realm of possibility against the old realm of possibility or what is sometimes termed an 'order of being'). The not of 'for all x, not x' either points back to the current contradiction *or* it points to a domain beyond the current contradiction, depending upon its material historical movement.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> So for example if I hit this contradiction 'not an apple and not not an apple': there are many ways 'not' can be read here to produce new possibilities. There are of course all the semi-contradictions that aren't contradictions (possibility vs. actuality for example --- an apple seed is actually not an apple but possibly not not an apple) or partiality vs. totality (the skin of the apple is not an apple but its also not not an apple) or brand domain vs biological domain (an apple computer is not an apple but its also not not an apple): these are all negations that could come out of this contradiction of 'not an apple and not not an apple' (i.e. they are all --- *not* 'not an apple and not not an apple' --- in some way that makes plausible sense but they all are different ways of make this plausible negation occur, they do not evoke the same object). But what you really want is a 'not' that actually points beyond the apple, non-apple dichotomy as a concept. So one that points internal and which is probably the embodiment of the contradiction to its fullest is the life-cycle of the apple (the movement from apple to seed to tree to cutting to tree to apple to seed to tree to.... etc.): that really is both an apple and not an apple in some very deep sense (i.e. it sublates an apple. Its not an apple, and apple is a concrete object and this is a lifecycle. However an apple is part of it, one of its steps, however it is an apple, in the sense that the commodity of a particular kind of apple can be tied to this entire life-cycle as a process through money/labor time and the interactions of the market, and it also completes an apple, in that you don't really understand what an apple is until you have at least some basic idea of what this process, but finally it also transcends the apple by providing the conditions for evolution of the apple into something else --- some other fruit or plant).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Its this last step which points out of the apple, i.e. which poses the question of the negative dialectic of the apple. Of course, apples transcend apples in that its always possible to evolve a better apple: a sweeter apple, an apple that keeps better, an apple that is more resistant to worms or fungus, etc. These are the internal transcendence of an apple (its 'desire' --- structural/object not subjective desire --- to evolve into another apple. This is a positive *attractor* that pulls the apple back into itself and it is this *attractor* which is the positive contradiction of the apple: not any concrete existing object but the negative space of a strange attractor), the way it points back to itself. But this very object 'evolution' is also (and primarily) a 'no' to what already exists in the realm of life: and in the specific realm of the apple, it would include all the things that aren't apples that evolve from an apple: i.e. it first cycles back into itself, but then it generalizes from 'apple evolution to apple' (self-referential or 'positive' contradiction) to 'apple evolution into non-apple' i.e. apple speciation (like what has started to happen to the brassicas). Next we get the general 'no' which is speciation split off from its specific origin (i.e. having nothing to do with apples, speciation as a pure speciation) and then generalization to the whole realm of life (i.e. back down the tree of life to life forms that came before apples and into the future and along all the branches). And at this point we hit a concrete ecology that *is* (i.e. what actually evolved) --- but this ecology has its own positive and negative contradiction (positive I think I can say: All the possible ecologies that could come out of the actually existing ecology through natural selection would be the positive contradiction: i.e. this *attractor* which pulls it back to the same kind of ecology, maybe one based on carbon life and water chemistries for example).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> I think you're misundestanding my point: I'm not saying you need a criterion for what is possible *vis a vis* what is impossible, I'm saying you need something establishing the possibility of something else *at all*. In your example, I'm not saying you need something to determine whether or not an apple is possible, I'm saying you need the idea of an apple for an apple to be possibly possible. If all you have is contradiction and nothing, then there is not just no way to distinguish between what is possible and what is impossible, there is more fundamentally no way something that could be possible could emerge.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> If I have nothing then I have 'no' which is not nothing and which is what is possible (its not nothing because the answer to the question 'is no nothing' is 'no'). 'no' is the first 'thing' --- less than nothing (in many senses, the most fun and sophistic one of course being that 'no' is literally fewer letters than 'nothing' --- zizek prefers 'othing' as this primordial 'no' however).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> And its also a requirement of nothing, a consequence (i.e. if you don't have 'no' you don't have nothing because nothing is that to which the answer to all questions about it is no --- including also the question 'is nothing that to which the answer to all questions is no?': i.e. nothing requires a no at its root at its base, for there to be nothing, there must be less than nothing).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> You say "nothing is that to which the answer to all questions about it is no"

You keep saying this, and now you explain it's the basis for why "no" is primary.
But I'm sorry, that concept of nothing is just a meaningless formalism. It has nothing to do with dialectics or Hegel.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> For example, you could as, "does nothing have a meaning?" Yes it does!
Hegel states this, it's also immediately clear. When we say the word, it holds meaning.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Actually nothing (as far as I can tell) is meaninglessness itself: that is its meaning. Its contradiction, its nothing, it gives no meaning and it receives no meaning. Meaning has to be found elsewhere, in something lesser. 

Hegel may or may not be reaching beyond formalism but my point is that there is only the formalism of formalism 'beyond' (though not really beyond) formalism: i.e. the very acknowledgement that you can be completely formally correct and still be wrong because of something that isn't accounted for in the formula and the reduction of formula itself to an empty point. But this acknowledgement doesn't 'defeat' formalism, it merely proposes a replacement formalism (i.e. one that does account for this new thing, whatever it is in the case of an outside thing, and one that is based on this empty point in the case of the empty point).</p>

I'm literally saying that I think Nothing can *only* be captured by a formula, that there is *nothing* beyond formalism (i.e. there is no in-formalism, truly) and I think that people should never fill in nothing with false meaning because that's how you get religious nonsense. 

Ultimately, my joke is always that I'm not joking.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@andru0358#0</span> Because the only reason most people read Hegel is because of Marx (and it really is the only reason for sublation to be reading Hegel) --- without Marx he's just another dead German Philosopher and the liberals love Kant more so Kant's the one whose going to get read more. I'm the one here to draw the distinction between the materialism of Marx and the Idealism of Hegel (and also the idealism of Marx and the materialism of Hegel since this division isn't completely consistent in either direction) to see how either is flawed. It's not a trolling, its the hermanuetic of suspicion to balance out a hermaneutic of faith (which I also have, most moves Hegel makes I'm fine not quibbling with). 

As for the libertarian objection, I would say no that's not what I'm doing. Because the libertarian is just ignoring something which Marx actually addresses (Marx, after all says that value is *socially necessary* labor). Like the libertarian's objection is also Marx's own objection *to other socialists* so the libertarian isn't even reading Marx. My objection, at least according to you, is not Hegel's objection. Hegel claims being and nothing are co-equal. I'll buy that Hegel says that, I'm just saying Hegel is wrong because of something he actually said (not something he didn't say in the case of the libertarian objecting to Marx --- that's bad faith).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> So I think that we got to an interesting point before (like months ago) and I think that you were proposing empty model/empty theory for nothing. 

I think I would like to propose this, first I don't think we can go with separate model and theory for nothing: I think we would need something more like a model-theory which is something that is translated both as a model and theory which either accepts or doesn't accept itself as its own model. So for example the model-theory: {'for all x, x is a statement in first order predicate logic'} would be self-accepting while the model-theor: {‘for all x, x is an elephant} wouldn’t be self accepting. So then let's say that nothing is the model theory {} or even better I’ll give it a symbol: ◻. So that’s the first step away from category theory I’d maybe take and I would call a theory model pair maybe a ‘system’ (unless there’s some better or standard name for it, I can’t find one) and I’d call this a self-referencing system.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> Now this seems to work for nothing in a way that doesn’t require any kind of ‘growth’ or ‘existence’ of the nothing (i.e. its just an empty model-theory, or we could even say its just emptiness itself). But I think there is a problem, certainly at least if we are looking at this from the perspective of category theory. The problem is that if a statement is not in a model in category theory that doesn’t mean the statement is either true or false but rather its undefined, which means in fact that the absence of the statement from a model is not a statement about its absence but rather a statement about its undefined character within the model. The model is unable to give meaning to the statement: it in fact has all possible values as possible values: or rather it has *none* of the possible values as values. It is the case that an undefined statement is both is not true and not not true --a contradiction. Or to put it another way, this emptiness is not actually an emptiness, but a gentleman’s agreement not to put a definition to things we aren’t considering and the development of a traditional classical logic actually pulls its non-assumptive determinations from this ‘sea of incoherence’ (i.e. nothing) that exists beyond (or rather, within) the emptiness. 

However, we may not want to violate this gentleman’s agreement right away and instead ask, what takes part of absolutely *every* statement in this sea of decoherence. And what I’m saying is that they all have a negation in front of them (even if they don’t because, of course not not x is also x). I.e. all statements of an undefined object are *not* true (i.e. the undefined statement is *not* true but its also *not not true* and thus, like how you can always find a room at the infinite hotel, you can always find a not in the sea of decoherence).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@nameiwillforget#0</span> But then I realized that there was one last problem with the undefined. The final objection which is the one you're making perhaps, is that 'okay' but there isn't anything that exists for the undefined to 'undefine'. But then the response is that the undefined is greedy --- it grabs everything 'outside' the model and undefines it. This would include the empty model-theory itself which is undefined in the empty model theory. Thus the not that is pulled out of the undefined is standing on top of nothing (the empty theory-model which is not true *in* the empty theory model and also not not true *in* the empty theory model).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Nothing, pure nothing: it is simply equality with itself, complete emptiness, absence of all determination and content — undifferentiatedness in itself. In so far as intuiting or thinking can be mentioned here, it counts as a distinction whether something or nothing is intuited or thought. To intuit or think nothing has, therefore, a meaning; both are distinguished and thus nothing is (exists) in our intuiting or thinking; or rather it is empty intuition and thought itself, and the same empty intuition or thought as pure being. Nothing is, therefore, the same determination, or rather absence of determination, and thus altogether the same as, pure being.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@firedog235#0</span> I'm a bit ill, so this is maybe too galaxy-brained for me, but if it grabs everything 'outside' the model, that implies something outside the model exists, and thus something exists, right?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I'm sorry you feel sick 😦 

No, because the only thing it grabs is the empty model-theory itself which is also, because it is empty, totally undefined (i.e. its nothing but undefined). However the undefined doesn't exist because its a kind of contradiction (it doesn't exist, but it also doesn't not exist)... but it definitely *doesn't exist* first. The undefined here is grabbing a hold of something that doesn't exist --- i.e. itself --- 'the undefined' under the name of the empty model-theory ◻  (which it can do because it is itself a contradiction so it doesn't care if it has internal contradictions). However a *consequence* of this undefined character is simply the less than nothing, ('not' or 'no'), which is not immediately contradictory and thus can exist (or rather ex-sist, stand out from nothing/contradiction). When this 'not' is combined internally with the undefined as 'not x and not not x' (or not undefined and not not undefined) it doesn't exist (because that whole statement points to something that doesn't exist --- that whole statement is also, itself, undefined), but when its pulled out as 'not (x or not x)' we end up with just 'not (T)' which is just 'not'. This is how nothing generates something (specifically the something of 'not').</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I have found out something interesting in the Houlgate book me and Doug are reading about the difference between ~~empirical~~ sensible intuition and intelectual intuition in Kant and Hegel and I think it is very important bearing on reading Hegel (especially in §120 in the intro which Alex was talking about on the Patreon thread.)

Sensible intuition for Kant is intuition of empirical/material reality and is merely correpondent or reflective as in you cant just think something and it appears in front of you. Intelectual intuition on the other hand is not dependent on reality, (it is therefore a priori/idealist and internal.) So what you think and what there is has no distinction as it does in sensible intuition, you think something and it appears there right before you.

Kant believes that Humans are only capable of sensible inuition and not intelectual intuition, they can't think something and it materialises infront of them, only God is capable of this intelectual intuition. Hegel on the other hand believes intelectual intuition is possible for Humans and infact this is exactly what he means by pure knowing. This is shown for example when he says in §120:

".....although the ego could be characterised as *pure knowing or as intelectual intuition*"

So everything Hegel is talking about here is in the realm of intelectual intuition, something Kant doesnt even believe is possible for mortals. I beleive this is why Hegel refers to it as being the mind of god before he creates anything because he is claiming to be able to perform intelectual intuition, something Kant says only God capable of doing.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I know the quote above is also talking about the Ego so it is a bit confusing but he says also a bit later:

"But what, at the beginning of the science, is actually present of intellectual intuition – or of the eternal, the divine, the absolute, if its object be so named – cannot be anything else than a first, immediate, simple determination. "

Still not totally clear but I believe he means that the begining contains *intellectual intuition* in its most minimal form, Being. I will look if there are more occurences of the phrase 'intelectual intuition'.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Been reading about Ficthe on Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and came across this about his use and developement of the term "intelectual intuition":

> This same “identity in difference” of original self-consciousness might also be described as an “intellectual intuition,” inasmuch as it involves the immediate presence of the I to itself, prior to and independently of any sensory content. To be sure, such an “intellectual intuition” never occurs, as such, within empirical consciousness; instead, it must simply be presupposed (that is, “posited”) in order to explain the possibility of actual consciousness, within which subject and object are always already distinguished. The occurrence of such an original intellectual intuition is itself inferred, not intuited.
> 
> Unfortunately, Fichte confuses matters by sometimes using the term “inner” or “intellectual intuition” to designate something else entirely: namely, the act of philosophical reflection or purified self-observation through which the philosopher becomes conscious of the transcendental conditions for the possibility of ordinary experience—among which, of course, is the occurrence of the “original” intellectual intuition as a Tathandlung. On other occasions, he employs the term “intellectual intuition” in yet another sense: namely, to designate our direct, practical awareness within everyday life of our moral obligations (categorical imperative qua “real intellectual intuition”). Given the subsequent abuse of this term by Schelling and the romantics, as well as the confusion that one sometimes finds among expositors of Fichte on this issue, it is crucial to recognize systematic ambiguity of the term “intellectual intuition” in Fichte’s own writings.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> So not sure if Hegels use of the term is affected by this "abuse" of the term by Schelling etc or not but already Fichte added to the obscurity of the term himself using it in 3 different ways it seems.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Started to read about Fichte because I came to the realisation that in 'With What Should The Science Begin' when he starts talking about the Ego in §117 he's actually talking about Fichte I think and not Descartes. This is aparent from the fact that he describes it as having "recently become famous" and at this point Descartes was already over 100 years ago and also it is Fichte and not Descartes who tried to derive the Categories from the I or the Ego.

Well deriving the categories like Hegel is doing might not be exactly what Fichte is trying to do but something similar.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I'm really amazed how similar Fichtes project seems to be as Hegels and how much they have in common such as how fichte believed that starting the philosophy with the principle of the 'I' could only be justified by the conclusion of the philosophy, very reminisent of Hegels idea of philosophy as a circle that is self grounding.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> It kind of seems to me though that Fichte is working in reverse to Hegel, that he works back from his initial principle (and Hegel rejects having a principle) to find the conditions for its possibility. This is also from Stanford:

> After establishing the first principle and conceiving the act expressed therein, the philosophical task is then to discover what other acts must necessarily occur as conditions for the possibility of the original, “simply posited,” first act and then to do the same for each of these successively discovered acts (or the theorems in which they are formulated). By continuing in this manner, one will, according to Fichte, finally arrive at a complete deduction of the a priori structure of ordinary experience or, what amount to the same thing, a complete inventory of the “original acts of the mind.” This is precisely the task of the first or “foundational” portion of the Jena system.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I’m really glad there’s new people in the group. I hope they feel like staying. Originally there were quite a few people but it gradually dwindled to me Thomas and Alex. I hope the new approach makes people feel like they can get more out of it this time.

I was thinking maybe we could even have our own zoom sessions in between the workshops to go over any difficult parts or talk about the more fundamental stuff.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I spent an hour reading the 18 introductory sections of Hegels shorter Logic this morning and I found it much easier to read than the prefaces to the SOL. I then went back and re-read the prefaces and found them much more digestible than I did when I just took a nose dive into them last year.
I think the shorter logic’s introduction acts as a good counter balance to the debates surrounding Hegels philosophical relationship to religion and the actual existing world - a debate that could last months - and it shows how one could easily be on either side of it.

Just putting that out there as a way for people to straightforwardly see where Hegel is coming from, and help them move passed sections of the SOL that read like they’re hieroglyphics.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I’m almost through the second preface and my favorite part so far are those passages about how people try to use the categories (either through abbreviation or determining objective relationships). But really the categories possess us! We wouldn’t say we use our feelings or impulses. We wouldn’t say they are at our disposal!

Another point I find curious is when he remarks on language. He says if you split mind and body than logic is sort of a supernatural force. Yet, later on, he says forget the objective notion of things because it’s actually subjective. So why even have that part about the supernatural logic?</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Thinking about it more I guess he answers my question when he uses the example of force and polarity. That an advance beyond abstraction and beyond identity (A = A) is important. That force acquired independent self-subsistence. Yet it’s still not enough because the further step is abstracting from the opposition to a generality.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Hegel is essentially asserting that there is no empiricism that could be more important than man’s free will and his conscious reasoning. Many Marxists have trouble threading this needle, because they don’t allow themselves to think like this - for them it’s progress with no regress.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> It’s that being and the Notion are the same and they relate to each through pure essentialities which are also the same. It’s like in Rousseau that the sovereign and the people are the same and relate through the government. Or that between subject and object is language, except he explicitly rejects this, and says that thought brings us further away from the object, and language seeps inward into man and contains categories sometimes even snuck in.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@headphon3jack#0</span> i havent got that far either and Im reading Stephen Houlgate mainly not as much the logic itself although i do read it from time to time, its way to interoperable for me on its own.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Im not sure but I think this might be the difference between what something is explicitly vs what it is implicitly, for example, determinate being (existence or being-there) is explicitly immediate/unmediated but implicitly, or hidden, it has mediation in it or behind it and the Logic progresses by making what is implicit explicit.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> I read like half of Kant’s critique of pure reason (I got through the transcendental deduction but it fried my brain). For Hegel I’ve read the master-slave dialectic but nothing beyond that and I don’t know his sense of appearance. I was using it in a loose way that I think can be traced back to the Greeks.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@headphon3jack#0</span> Well I can't say I know enough to say if youre right or wrong but its interesting to speculate and I did a google search of Hegelian appearance and implicit expicit and just read the stupid AI explaination but it has some paralels to what youre saying. There is a whole section in the logic called appearance so I think Hegel definately develops it a lot further than the common understanding of the word but Im sure its connected in some way to the usual sense of the word like you are thinking. Kant actually just uses the word appearance to mean how things are presented to us through the senses I think and I think hegel will probably develop it from there in someway.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> heres google AIs result on appearance

In the philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, appearance is the relationship between form and content, and the idea that the content of something is only accessible through its form. 
Explanation
Form and content
Appearance is the recognition of the difference between form and content, and the idea that these two things are not always identical. 
Essence
Appearance is the second grade of essence, and is the concrete existence of essence. 
Transient and unstable
Appearance is a modification of being, but it is transient and unstable because it is still partial or abstract. 
Dialectical process
Appearance develops through a dialectical process, where a multiplicity of forms build up and stand in contradictory relationship to their content. 
Higher than being
Appearance is higher than being because it combines reflection-into-self and reflection-into-other. 
Hegel's ideas about appearance are discussed in his works Logic, Outline of Logic, and Shorter Logic.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Anyone read anymore of the preferances or anything? I actually started reading the intro to the phenomenology (the preferance is too long and difficult and is supposedly a kind of summary of the whole thing or almost a sort of afterword) and my god its less arduous than the Logic, much more colourful and kind of alive.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> This was fascinating, talking about time and how important it is to the whole system and in fact she thinks the logic is the structure of time. So we say the logic isn’t developing temporally and yet is the structure of time, the description of it but also it itself I think</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Kant says sensuous intuitive experience begins the cognitive process. The cognitive faculties of understanding, judgement, and reason.  He believes he can separate out sensuous intuition from necessary, universal, formal, a priori knowledge. 

His goal is to give the ground for the possibility of synthetic a priori knowledge. He contrasts synthetic judgement that add or augment  (A=B) from analytic or identity judgements (A=A). He wants to deal with the a priori or pure forms of these judgements. He points out that math and physics have synthetic a priori judgements as principles and we don’t even know how they are possible.

What if we can’t separate the immediate from the mediate? Then we have no practical interaction with the thing in itself and can not know it except discursively not sensuously. Kant had written that the faculty of reason was the part of cognition that dealt with concepts that had no object (freedom of will, god, the soul) but now it seemed like they were distanced from all being. Being-in-itself is noumenal. I think this is the point where Hegel comes in.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I’d say also what if there is no grounds for synthetic a priori judgements? Based on the preface from the science of logic it at least seems like he’s making an analytic judgement that being and the notion are identical.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@headphon3jack#0</span> in the first chapter of the Houlgate book were reading he says that Kant only believes that a statement like the straight line between 2 points, is synthetic only because he doesn't see the categories as inherent in each other but wholy seperate. I think Hegel does actually believe this is synthetic or even mathematics afterall, at least some kinds of maths.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> It’s the part about the Notion being separated into two moments of its totality: 1. *the* substantial Notion as one 2. It’s determinateness or particular content that is generated by bringing brought before consciousness and evaluated as self-independent and external. If it’s all one substantial, fundamental Notion then it seems to me nothing is synthetic or augmentative. Instead we are only overcoming the limits of reason by gaining insight into the contradiction.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> It’s after he discusses the way the categories are used wrong (as abbreviations for a multitude of particulars and as objective relations). He mentions that viewing the categories as having external form goes along with that. Then he says that really it’s not just about the relationship between the thing-in-itself and its actuality, but between the thing and it’s knowledge of itself. The categories becomes the essence of the Notion that are seen as self-independent and the Notion knowing itself. Hegel put it something like things-in-themselves are an infinitely varied (undetermined) material that has firm knots or nodes (the categories) in it.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@headphon3jack#0</span> I believe Hegel has big problems with the thing in itself at least in the way Kant understands it. He does however have a Category of being-in-itself in the second chapter 'Determinate Being'</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Yeah the kantian picture is that our thoughts don’t bring our subjectivity closer to the object or a thing-in-itself but cuts us off from it. Hegel wants to embrace knowing the infinite because the truth is infinite. If we can grasp totality of being, or the infinite truth, then that’s against Kant’s picture and also against the idea that we can only know totality it by its limitation.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> When that inner determination serves as its particular content then the negation isn’t an absolute negation into nothingness, but the negation itself has a positive aspect. It’s the positive aspect of the negation that can give us insight into the contradictions. That’s how we raise reason beyond limitation.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Hegel was saying that ordinary, common sense had adopted the objective notion of things and rejected logic and thus out truth to one side by seeing form as only attached to content and not included in determining it.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> No this is hegel’s criticism of ordinary common sense and how they didn’t appreciate the categories that appeared to mind as fragments. They didn’t take time to clarify those fragments with logic because logic appeared empty of content to them.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Yeah it’s difficult and Hegel adds another difficulty which is his critique of ‘thoroughness’. You know, to be thorough would be to examine the beginning and firmly establish it before moving on. 

But those that fundamentally misunderstand the first Notions of Logic (being, nothing, and becoming —becoming containing the first two as moments) will reject the beginning, and therefore all the rest, as not firmly established in the name of thoroughness (but really it’s laziness and reducing mental labor). 

Thoroughness tends to do the opposite of itself and brings in categories and propositions that lie beyond the initial principles eg. That content is different than form, infinity different than finitude, mediation is no immediacy, etc. even though it is unjustified to presuppose such propositions. In fact it’s the business of logic to enquire into the truth of those propositions.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Hegel wrote that the education and discipline of thinking, by which it acquires plasticity and overcomes the impatience of casual reflection, is procured solely by going forward with the study of the science of logic, (he referred to it as skeptical philosophy or metaphysics proper) and carrying the entire development out to its conclusions.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@headphon3jack#0</span> <@1275846548932132864> One thing interesting in these passages is Hegel saying that freedom can be obtained through thinking in this refined way. In usual activities we find that we arent in control of what were doing at all, were driven by desires which we cant control and can hardly then call our own or that we master them.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think Kant thinks alternatively that we all have some kind of freedom simply by being having one foot in the noumenal realm. Or thats what Ive gathered from reading an intro</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> wheras hegel says we can be totally free by thinking dialectically. 

"When we give ourselves up to a sensation, a purpose, an interest, and in it feel ourselves confined and unfree, the place into which we can withdraw ourselves back into freedom is this region of self-certainty, of pure abstraction, of thought."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> There’s a tricky part there in regards to what is more universal and what is more particular between the categories (when used as abbreviations or objective relations) and the finite nature of an individual human. I’d say Hegel’s claim is we have to withdraw back to logic (ie. Thought as thought) in order to find freedom from being used by the categories.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> you have finitude vs infinity as a dialectic but that infinity turns out to be only a bad infinity in his words because if it is up against finitude as its limit it can't be truly infinite because it stops where finitude begins.
Infinity can only be true when it is completely self detemined and this happens because finitude and (bad/spurious)infinity become sublated into being just moments (aspects) of the higher concept of true infinity.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Its also in the introduction when he discusses the beginning of the science being the notion. But then in the next section, about with what science must begin, he says philosophy must begin with either mediation or immediacy which is what Doug was talking about in the last session.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> It’s like when you determine a side of the contradiction and hold it steady, then it’s only an empty abstraction.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> I’m halfway through that part, but I think he wants to start with pure immediacy but not as empty abstraction.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> I think he says the notion of science is presupposed as a starting point from the inner determinations of mind (thought coming to know itself?). Just like how the categories becomes the nodes or knots in the self-infinite material of the thing in itself when they are brought before mind. It is thought recognizing itself as thought through thought.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> The important part, it seems, is that spirit is fundamentally consciousness and this self knowing (the bringing the categories before consciousness —- which are universal because the hold many particulars under one unity) is a fundamental determination of its actuality.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> So there’s the thing itself and the thing in it’s actually, but the self-knowing of the thing also determines that actuality.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> This was part of the argument that rejects viewing the categories (aka the determinations of thought) as external forms that are distinct from the matter of thought and only attached to it.  It’s rejected because it’s inadequate for truth. It’s inadequate for truth because a mere form with no content is assumed to be determined as finite and incapable of holding truth in its self-infinite.</p>

"The most important point for the nature of spirit is not only the relation of what it is in itself to what it is actually, but the relation of what it knows itself to be to what it actually is; because spirit is essentially consciousness, this self-knowing is a fundamental determination of its actuality."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I have a weird way of taking notes but I’m thinking of this part that comes before the part we’re talking about. Basically if the notion is the indispensable  foundation and the categories (which are also notions) relate us to the thing-in-itself by it being a self-knowing and all the same thing in different moments of the Notion.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The beginning of philosophy is the foundation which is present and preserved throughout the entire subsequent development, and remains completely immanent in its further determinations. 

Progress in philosophy is a retrogression, a grounding, or an establishing by means of which we first obtain the result that what we began with is in fact truth (not just arbitrary), and also primary truth. —- It is an important consideration that the advance is a retreat into the ground. A retreat into what is primary and true on which what the beginning is made, depends, and originates.

The essential requirement for the science of logic is not so much that the beginning be a pure immediacy, but rather that the whole of science be a circle within itself, in which the first is also last and the last also first.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The progress from that which forms the beginning is to be regarded as only a further determination of it, hence that which forms the starting point of the development remains at the base of what follows (doesn’t vanish from it).</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Progress in knowing is not provisional, hypothetical, or problematical because it is the result which appears as the absolute grounds. Progress in knowing must be determined by the nature of the subject matter itself and its content. This beginning is not something neither an arbitrary or provisional assumption, nor something which appears to be arbitrarily or tentatively presupposed, but subsequently shown to be properly made the beginning.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Pure knowing only yields a negative determination that beginning is to be abstract. If pure being is to be the content of pure knowing, then the pure knowing must stand back from its content, and not determine it further. Or, if pure being is to be considered the unity into which knowing has collapsed (at the extreme points of its union with the object), then knowing itself has vanished in that unity, which would leave behind no difference from the unity by which the  knowledge itself could determined. Nor is there anything else present, any content, that could make the beginning more determinate.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> So he’s saying how that is the presupposition of the science of logic but pure knowing must stand back from it it and not determine it any further, so in that way pure being is in a way presupositionless like he says although I’m a bit foggy exactly how</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> One thing to key in on is that it’s not an essential requirement for the science of logic that the beginning be pure being or pure immediacy. It’s about the circle of scientific advancement that’s created by the result being the ground. In this way progress in philosophy is a retrogression.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Sent this question to Stephen Houlgate and just got a response. This was my email:


> Hi Stephen,
> 
> I just wondered if you could explain what Hegel means when he says in the 2nd Preface to the Science of logic § 24:
> 
> "The most important point for the nature of spirit is not only the relation of what it is in itself to what it is actually, but the relation of what it knows itself to be to what it actually is; because spirit is essentially consciousness, this self-knowing is a fundamental determination of its actuality."
> 
> Is the first point, 'the relation of what it is in itself to what it is actually' a description of the Kantian perspective of the thing in itself?
> 
> I think i understand the last point, that knowing itself is part of what it is to be self conscious, it is a defining characteristic of self consciousness so spirit doesnt need as in the first point to find out what it really is in comparison to its notion of itself because knowing that is its very determination.
> 
> its the middle bit 'the relation of what it knows itself to be to what it actually is'. I can't fathom what this relation would consist of and what the significance of it would be.

> This will have to be a quick response, but I hope it helps. 
> 
> When Hegel speaks of what spirit is "in itself" (an sich), this has nothing to do with Kant. The comparison is between what spirit is implicitly and what it is explicitly ("actually"). So, in his philosophy of history Hegel argues that all spirit — that is, all human self-consciousness — is implicitly free, but not all spirit is explicitly free. So, e.g., the Egyptians were implicitly free (as self-conscious) but not explicitly free, since they did not develop the rights and institutions of true freedom.
> 
> The second point is that we need to compare what spirit knows itself to be with what it is explicitly (actually). You are right that self-knowledge belongs to what we are explicitly, but it does not exhaust the latter. Otherwise, we could never misunderstand ourselves — or fail to understand fully who we are. 
> 
> This is related to the question of the categories of thought. They are "instinctively" at work in who we actually are, but this doesn't mean that we understand them fully — that we know fully who and what we are. The task of the Logic, therefore, is to disclose how the categories are properly to be understood, and this understanding may run contrary to how we normally understand them (an understanding that currently governs who we actually are). 
> 
> Coming to understand the categories properly, therefore, will transform who we actually are, since, as you say, self-knowledge belongs to who we actually are. So it makes a difference to who we actually are if we have a clear understanding of the categories that inform our lives, or if they are just unconsciously at work within us. In the latter case, we will, or may, suffer the dialectic that they contain without understanding why.
> 
> I hope this sheds some light on this issue.

> Best wishes,

> Since, therefore, subjective thought is our very own, innermost, act, and the objective notion of things constitutes their essential import, we cannot go outside this our act, we cannot stand above it, and just as little can we go beyond the nature of things. ® We can however disregard the latter determination; in so far as it coincides with the first it would yield a relation of our thoughts to the object, but this would be a valueless result because it would imply that the thing, the object, would be set up as a criterion for our notions and yet for us the object can be nothing else but our notions of it.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> hes saying how can the object be the criterion for our notions when all the object is for us 'is' our notions of it. How can our notions be the criterion for our notions, thats just circular logic.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> It makes sense to think about it in terms of implicit and explicit. I wonder if that is equivalent to saying as subject to object? He clarified, too, that there is more to what is explicit than self-knowledge, because if there wasn’t then there would be no misunderstanding about the explicit objects aka who we are. It seems like it will be that the categories of thought, as pure essence recognized as self by self conscious, will be the clear understanding of the categories.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Yeah I think that’s gotta be a stretch. If it’s all thought it’s all thought, but then what is explicit? I still believe we have to say that thought is implicit, but the explicit actuality of appearance for the Egyptian slave was not free. Therefore, the outside of subjective thought must appear as an object even if it is ultimately recognized as self-conscious thought.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> But an explicit or implicit criterion of judgement can’t be the start of philosophy because that presupposes the absolute idea which we’d judge the beginning by, and it presupposes that the understanding is the faculty of judgement. When we really try to start without any presupposition then we are left with sheer indeterminate being or pure being. We can’t know it’s truth by judging it against its further development, because as an indeterminate beginning we can’t presuppose its further development. It must happen immanently.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@headphon3jack#0</span> I guess hes saying here that the beggining cant be a judgement in some way but what I think he's saying more broadly is that the judgement that an earlier category is deficient in comparison to a later one isnt the driving force for a category to develop into a more sufficient category.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think mctaggarts idea is that we have kind of 2 conceptions in our brain, firstly we *implicitly* have the complete truth which is absolute knowing and which is what our our thinking is and secondly we have *explicitly* the category that we are currently contemplating and the first is used as the criterion to judge the second as deficient and drives us on to develop it to a further category.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> It’s that Kant presupposes things about understanding and  judgement that are presuppositions insufficient to a critical philosophy. Further, I think even assuming the development that a category undergoes into a higher stage is a presupposition being wanted about. On my reading, that is the presupposition of the immanent criterion for truth if we follow the development.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@headphon3jack#0</span> I don't think what i said disagrees with you there. I didnt say anything about presupposing that a category developes into a higher stage, if it seemed like that it might have been because I was decribing Mctaggarts position which Houlgate is criticising</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@headphon3jack#0</span> Im not sure what i was saying is totally right now but I was thinking about when Hegel kind of says that understanding is intuitive not just discursive (judgement). Think I confused the words intuitive and immediate a bit although it does seem that intuition would be immediate and judgement a mediation. Im really tired, its 3am! Need to go to bed. Hopefully see you in the workshop. You are the jack who joins the workshop sometimes right?</p>

I’ll say tho that you laid out Kant’s view of judgement, and that’s what I had thought about too prior reading Holgate. Now I think we can’t presuppose that.</p>

> I think Thomas you are operating under a misunderstanding of what Zizek is saying when you privilage nothing over being. Here is an explaination of Zizeks theory of less-than-nothing by Cadell Last
> 
> "To push the Idea of “why is there nothing rather than something” further Žižek plays with the idea that in order to achieve “pure nothingness” (like the image of Death) you first have to be “something” (i.e. it is only a subject that can conceive of the pure nothingness of Death); and it is then his claim that because of this phenomenological fact we can say that the excessive visions and images of “something more” that appear internal to the symbolic order over and above “physical reality” (like those images offered in religions and many other metaphysical systems); signify that we must propose a third ontological category that breaks the dualism of something and nothing with the triad of something-nothing-less than nothing."</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> > "In this way the triadic relation between something-nothing-less than nothing structures the symbolic order because the “something” of our reality is overdetermined by the paradoxical nature of less than nothing (as in the triadic structure introduced above). Later in the work we will go into greater depth about the nature of this less than nothing. However, for now, we will say that reality as a totality, for Žižek, is not just “something” of material processes and “nothing” of the void; but also the “less than nothing” of virtuality which he claims has not yet been understood properly ontologically."
> 
> So if Cadell is correct Zizek thinks that to have pure nothing you have to have something or being to think nothing from. This is exactly what I was getting at when I said that to concieve of yourself as being nothing this already implys that the is something because you can't have nothing without something to think it from. And then less-than-nothing is even further the case as this is a completely virtual concept.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@headphon3jack#0</span> <@1275846548932132864> pretty annoyed the group didn’t talk about houlgate at all and just got stuck on this thing Thomas goes on about every time for the whole workshop. Did you talk about anything interesting before I arrived? Sorry I was late, maybe I could’ve tried to steer the group some other place</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Oh he does it every time? I thought it was relevant because the houlgate chapter was about the presupposition less, and how different interpreters believed they found a presupposition Hegel missed. I myself thought pure knowing might have been a presupposition, and now I know better. I feel like I got somewhere in the last workshop but I haven’t fully worked it out yet.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think there’s something about how yes, simple immediacy does come from a mediation and a reference. But it’s sublated and therefore indifferent. Meaning we can start with pure knowing that has removed itself from certainty.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@headphon3jack#0</span> Sound about right. I’m not going to say I completely understand how he derives being from the end, after all he says only after the whole things been gone through do you get the justification or the logical ground (as apposed to the historical ground as houlgate says) and we’ve barely got started</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Hegel wrote that the beginning must either be immediate or mediated, but either way we go (objective principle or subjective criterion) is refuted. This necessitates joining the form with the content, and finding the beginning in the development of thought itself. In grounding it and not presupposing it. So it is an issue if we can’t ground immediate being as the beginning.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Exactly, all of these ideas must be utterly mastered in their most accurate form, and then the problems with them can be described. It is a matter of understanding the thing first without agreeing or disagreeing with it, letting it have its hours on the stage. Then the dissection begins.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> I agree, and I’m trying to do that. It may be a misreading that beginning with pure immediacy of being over nothing is presupposition, and we can just as well begin with nothing. After all, Descartes showed us that even with a method of radical doubt we still have to admit there is something —- Hegel only says to drop the ego out of that and say “thinking, therefore, is”</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Immanent implies reasoning within the same system as the thing itself analysed, to my knowledge. Sometimes this is a bad thing. I don't want to live in the delusional universe of each system. They're not all equal.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Now, starting from the determination of pure knowledge, the only thing needed to ensure the beginning remains immanent in its scientific development is to consider what is there before us. Pure knowing, as concentrated into this unity, has sublated all reference to an other and to mediation. It is without distinction, and as distinctionless, ceases itself to be knowledge. It is only simple immediacy. Simple immediacy is itself an expression of reflection and contains a reference to its distinction from what it is mediated. Simple immediacy, in its true expression, is pure being. Just as pure knowing is knowing as such, so too is pure being nothing but being in general (being and nothing else — no further specification). —- Here the beginning is made with being represented as having come to be through mediation, and this mediation is also sublating itself. There is a presupposed pure knowing as the outcome of finite knowing (of consciousness). But if no presupposition is to be made, and the beginning itself is to be taken in immediately, then it’s only determination is it ought to be the beginning of logic (of thought as such). All that is present is the resolve to consider thought as such. —- Thus the beginning must be an abstract or absolute beginning that is to be itself the ground of the entire science, so it may not be mediated by anything or have a ground (not suppose anything). Consequently, it must be purely and simply an immediacy (merely an immediacy itself). It cannot possess any determination relatively to anything else, and it cannot contain within itself any determination or content, because such determinations would be a distinguishing and interrelationship of distinct moments (consequently a mediation). The beginning therefore is pure being.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> PoMo in its attenuated form has something to offer here. We get our notions of the thing, not the thing, we don't have access to the man, only his acolytes and explainers and translators. So we get a tradition, this is the most academic way to approach it. There are *traditions* of Marxism, of Hegel, of whatever. So we are interacting with one seeming on a certain axis. Still, we can do our best about that essence to which we have the most reasonable, wide, and honest access to try to wrestle the thing itself.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> That's the old PoMo I am using there, the "get more data" kind. Not the "nothing exists and this is a positive argument for the nonexistence of all" PoMo. I think these are extremised versions of each other and end up being quite different things in a final analysis.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Yeah and that’s what Hegel is explicitly not doing. Kant has 4 quantity, quality, relation, and modality. Hegel is starting with quality, saying quantity is negative quality, and measure is a specific relation but not relation in general. He also says something about magnitude which is that  it includes the alterability of Being, but Being itself does not change.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Just put this in the patreon comments:

I don’t think Thomas is right that what is left over is this negation or x is not x or whatever. What is left is just pure immediacy. All mediation has been abstracted away it’s not there. The only mediation there is implicit, it is implied that it will come later in the development. What implicit means is that all the information is there to know what being will be in the further development when it becomes explicitly posited because the science is completely necessary it can only be one way, what the beggining implies it will be</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> this is from hegel glossary by  Sebastian Gardner: (as he says Miller translates this as implicit)

> IN ITSELF (an sich). Merely potential or implicit (Miller often translates an sich as 'implicit'). Something is 'in
> itself' when it is considered separately from other things, and (in the case of a form of consciousness) when it is
> unreflective. That is why, for Hegel, the in itself is mere potentiality: actuality requires determination, negation,
> relations with other things. Note that a thing may be 'in itself for us' (an sich für uns), an expression Hegel uses
> often: this just means that we are considering it as it is separate from other things. Contrasts with: for itself, and inand-for-itself.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> this part too is interesting as it explains a bit about what explicit means:

> ACTUAL, ACTUALITY (wirklich, Wirklichkeit). Fully-developed, matured. Actuality thus incorporates a

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> I think the “All X is Not X” line is a logic puzzle meant to showcase a way to conceive of nothing. I agree with many of your points, but something is wrong when you say “All mediation has been abstracted away it’s not there”. I would instead say that all mediation has been sublated, and therefore annihilated, yes, but also internalized. So mediation is not all gone, but it is indifferent.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Well it may be different aspects of it. If we’re dropping out the I, the ego, the self-consciousness and trying to ground being in pure immediacy, then they can’t just be the same thing. The objective idealists, according to that Beiser book, and I agree this is what Hegel has written, makes the following point: the transcendental subject can not be the precondition of the categories and be less universal than the categories.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> They’re discussing the two types of idealisms they found when studying German Idealism: the subject or formal idealism attributed to Kant and Fichte, and objective idealism attributed to the Romantics, Schelling, and Hegel. That the subject and object must have some identity to explain the possibility of knowledge, but to account for this reality they’re led to some dualism given that objects appear as independent of our conscious control. So the problem of German Idealism is how to find a principle of subject-object identity that could surmount but also explain external reality.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> When he discusses how we retreat to freedom in thought because the categories seem more universal than us. Although, I’m not sure if he’s arguing for a ground or for foundationalism anymore. If Beiser is correct, then he may be arguing for a regulative instead of a principle.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> It’s like Kant’s transcendental subject is instead just the appearance of the absolute. How we can know it because it does appear to the subject. Which makes it the highest development of nature and reason. But then at some point Hegel puts less emphasis on nature and more on society, the state, and history.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> “Schelling, Hegel, Schlegel, Hölderlin, and Novalis all held that the absolute comes to its fullest realization, organization, and development only in the self-awareness of the knowing subject.

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I’m reading the section on the “Foundation”, and it’s just like damn this is really the guy Hegel is arguing against for a lot of the preface and introduction. Some things that stand out to me are that Hegel for sure doesn’t want to begin with the I or absolute ego, and he definitely thinks we can affirm truth behind its limit and negation. You’re right about developing the idea of deducing the categories from what thought is minimally, but maybe Hegel’s right that it’s not the I.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@headphon3jack#0</span> Yeah I think he means it seriously tho, I even believe having heard a lecture about Hegel on time that even time (which they also said the logic was the logical framework of time) goes forward and backwards, not literally like you can move back in time exactly, but that its a backwards anbd forward moving relationship there.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> and actually when it comes to time a moment actually becomes like a moment as we would understand the word to mean, like one moment after another, and these are taken together in one sublation.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> even Einstein I believe came to the conclusion that time isnt just a forward moving thing, its more that its an all at once thing but its just the way that we percieve time that it is kind of sequential like that.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@headphon3jack#0</span> right, what im saying though is that it is pressuposed as the historical justification for starting with pure being but not a logical presuposition of the logic itself which remains totally presupositionless</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> Oh I’m still digesting the chapter and I haven’t exactly finished it. The thing that incited me to post was that I had been thinking about a relation between being and nothing, but for their to be a relation it must be a determinate being rather than indeterminate. So unity of being and nothing is that they’re inseparable but also distinct. Their difference is completely empty and doesn’t exist in themselves but in a third —becoming, in which both pure being and pure nothing subsist. Because even though they are able to be isolated in abstraction that isolation is not true, and they are in fact inseparable but distinct.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@headphon3jack#0</span> <@1275846548932132864> having read that stuff about German idealism you might actually find zizeks book less than nothing quite interesting. I just read the introduction and he talks about all the different German idealists before Hegel and their various attempts to overcome the subject object divide thing. Like holderlin filling the gap with false narrative but Hegel puts this gap holderlin wants to overcome into the thing itselfs own makeup. He does say that Lacan is essential to reappropriate Hegel today tho which may be off putting but I’m actually quite interested in what he’s got to say. Might be worth reading the introduction if you are interested and I hope I can stop Thomas befuddling the group with his pseudo zizek</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> It’s amazing too btw how Hegelian holderlin sounds using words like immediacy and mediation, etc. you can see that Hegel wasn’t writing in a vacuum and there was a real symbiotic relationship with the others and a lot of debt to their work</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The difference of being and nothing is not found in themselves, so it must be found in a third, but not a subjective third with an opinion (opinion is outside the logic), and Hegel says becoming is that third in which being and nothing subsist as moments.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> We start with indeterminate pure being, and since indeterminate is logically the negation of determination, then we can arrive at determinate being in an immediate way —— And we don’t get stuck at the beginning as an end that needs a second beginning, or something external to it.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I wanted to say, additionally, that this stuff about becoming, and especially his focus on the Eleatic tradition, which he puts Spinoza and Ficthe in too, is because he’s refuting the third man argument against an issue those dogmatic idealist have with external reflection. Since they believed there can’t be an identity between identity and non-identity, then they begin with immediate being, but that beginning can’t progress and is an end. So, they need a second beginning or something external added in reflection (which is indifferent to the actual objects). Hegel is saying no, there is an identity between identity and non-identity. Being is the same as nothing, but it is still different, and even though that speculative can’t be proposed in a judgment, we can still follow the vanishing point where the one turns into the other.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> I’ve not read a word of Spinoza directly, but I’ve read around him and I think God or Nature being equivalent as the One, which Hegel says the Eleatic tradition is correct on being the historically necessary starting point. So maybe. What I’ve read about the third man argument is it leads to an infinite regress.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Find ing 153 very difficult to understand. I get its mainly to say that being and nothing can't be thought as completely seperate from each other and only subsist in becoming as a transition from one into the other but the particulars are quite tricky</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> its this bit where he starts to talk about reflection:

> Now wherever and in whatever form being and nothing are in question, this third must be present; for the two terms have no separate subsistence of their own but are only in becoming, in this third. But this third has many empirical shapes, which are set aside or ignored by abstraction in order to hold fast, each by itself, these its products, being and nothing, and to show them protected against transition. Such simple procedure of abstraction can be countered, equally simply, by calling to mind the empirical existence in which that abstraction is itself only a something having a determinate being. Or else it is some other form of reflection which is supposed to effect the separation of what is inseparable. Such determination carries within itself its own opposite, and, without referring back and appealing to the nature of the thing itself, the determination of reflection can be refuted in its own self by taking it just as it presents itself and pointing out in it its own other.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> I think that’s referring back to either an inner or external reflection. The first would be like an analysis which separates out the concepts parts and making logical judgements and the latter would be like synthesizing two abstract concepts together in a unity of the understanding with logical judgements.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> I don’t think so! I think here is related to another a comment he made in the first remark about how the later metaphysicians (Christians) rejected that nothing comes from nothing, and accepted that the world could be created from nothing. But he said they only understood this imaginatively (an isolated concept which can be analysed by its inner determinations) and synthetically (adding concepts to each other with an external reflection that is indifferent to the objects)</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The Eleatics and Plato saw all appearances as illusion, and only trusted the truth in reason. They believed in a world of forms that was the universal for all the particulars. The One over many. Plato criticized his own conception of this in Parmenides and came up with argument from a third. In doing research on this I’ve found the phrasing of it as a third man argument comes from Aristotle.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> I wouldn’t focus too much on that term. I think it just reminds us that inner reflection analyses concepts, and external reflection synthesizes concepts, but those are determinate. Hegel is trying to clarify the categories by not just separating them abstractly, but seeing them beyond the rational limit of the one-sided opposition.</p>

If being and nothing are the same, then having a hundred dollars and not having a hundred dollars is the same, but that alters the premise and makes being and nothing determinate.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Kant is saying that we cannot get to the actual existence (he uses the term existence different than Hegel) just from the possibility or concept of a hundred dollars. So the ontological proof is refuted. Because for him the possible does not contain any more being than the actual, since being (Kant has being as equivalent to existence) can’t be a real predicate to a subject, or a property of an object.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> > Later, especially Christian, metaphysics whilst rejecting the proposition that out of nothing comes nothing, asserted a transition from nothing into being; although it understood this proposition synthetically or merely imaginatively, yet even in the most imperfect union there is contained a point in which being and nothing coincide and their distinguishedness vanishes.

whats the significance of synthetically here? My understanding synthetic means the opposite of analytic, analytic knowledge is contained in a definition (like all batchelors are unmarried) and synthetic is new knowledge</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> They argued against that. Christians think the world was created, and therefore had a beginning, rather than being eternal. It seems to me that the Christians understood that being comes from nothing, but they synthetically added the concept of determinate being to the concept of determinate nothing. I’m going outside the text now to speculate, but it seems the Christians did have a third that they symbolically represent in the trinity. Like maybe if we think of God as being, the Holy Spirit as nothing, and therefore both are determinately related in the determinate being Jesus.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@headphon3jack#0</span> but if you see tyhe way hes writen it, he says they understood the proposition synthetically. The only proposition hes mentioned is that nothing comes out of nothing. That being comes out of nothing isnt described as a proposition. I could be being too pedantic

what im saying is its not clear from the way its writen which proposition is being refered to although it should probably be intuitively obvious if you understand what hes talking about</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@headphon3jack#0</span> im not sure why your saying imaginative means ending at the beggining in isolation. Isnt Hegel just using the word imagination to mean theyre just kind of vaguely imagining some kind of connection between being and nothing?

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> No he says they understood it either synthetically or imaginatively. The proposition he mentions they reject is nothing comes from nothing. The proposition they support is that nothing comes from being, and they might synthetically add together those two isolated concepts of the imagination.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@minimaltom#0</span> I mean that the progress Hegel makes is immediate and not in any kind of reflection or judgement. Immediate being is already a ‘not’. It’s not determinate being. It’s immediately there logically or in thought as such.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> It’s one sided because it dues not include the difference but makes being and nothing distinguish, therefore canceling itself and contradicting. Judgements can’t get to the speculative. The vanishing point between the two one-sided propositions gives us an indication of the becoming.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The same is the case with nothing, only contrariwise, and this familiar reflection on it has been made often enough. Nothing, taken in its immediacy, shows itself as affirmative (shows itself as being), for according to its nature it’s the same as being. Nothing is thought of (imagined of, spoken, of) and therefore is, in the thinking, imagining, and speaking. Further, this being is also distinguished from it. Therefore, although there is nothing in thought (it is said), yet it is for that very reason that it is not nothing that is. Being does not belong to this nothing as such, but this being is only thought (or imagination). With this distinguishing, it is equally not to be denied that nothing stands ins relationship to being, but in a relation (even though it contains the difference) there is present a union with being. In whatever way nothing is indicated (enunciated), it shows it’s connected with (or in contact with) a being (unseparated from a being) —- that is to say, in a determinate being.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Just searched imagination in the pdf of the logic and got this in the glossary

> “figurative representation,” or “representation of the imagination.”</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> There’s a bit more towards the end of remark 3 that I want to bring up. It’s when he says the transition of being and nothing into each other is is to be understood with no further elaboration of the transition by reflection. It’s immediate and quite abstract, because the determinateness of either moment is not yet posited in the other. Nothing is not yet posited in being, even though being essentially nothing. That makes it impermissible to say being is the ground of nothing and vice versa, or nothing is the cause of being and so forth. Or that the transition from one to the other can only occurs under a condition that something is or under the condition of non-being. The kind of connection can’t be further determined without both sides being further determined. The connection of a ground to a consequent no longer has merely being and nothing as its two sides which it connects, but expressly being is a ground, and something (although merely posited and self-subsistent), is yet not the abstract nothing.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> It is therefore inadmissible to employ more developed forms of mediation here and to hold being and nothing in any kind of relationship — the transition in question is not yet a relation.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Im thinking Thomas may be right that you could start with nothing rather than being (although im not sure and i think there are probably good reasons to start with being which i intend to find) but I think it doesnt make a bit of difference to the development</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;">@headphon3jack#0</span> I think what hes saying is that to think being as a ground is to think of it as being something which is more developed than pure abstract being</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> It’s that becoming contains two unities. Each of which is a unity of being and nothing. The one is being as immediate and as relation to nothing, and the other nothing as immediate as relation to being. The determinations are of unequal values in these unities.</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> yes i think thats right, and the reason becoming turns into determinate-being is because coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be logically cancel each other out</p>

          <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> § 179

Both are the same, becoming, and although they differ so in direction they interpenetrate and paralyse each other. The one is ceasing-to-be: being passes over into nothing, but nothing is equally the opposite of itself, transition into being, coming-to-be. This coming-to-be is the other direction: nothing passes over into being, but being equally sublates itself and is rather transition into nothing, is ceasing-to-be. They are not reciprocally sublated — the one does not sublate the other externally — but each sublates itself in itself and is in its own self the opposite of itself.</p>
